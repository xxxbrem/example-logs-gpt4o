Below are SQL queries, each with annotations, strictly based on the information available in the given tables. Each query is designed to incrementally explore the tables and extract relevant data for the task of analyzing post-market close stock price changes for the "Magnificent 7" tech companies.

```sql
-- Description:
-- Retrieve distinct variable names in the STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES table to understand available metrics related
-- to stock prices and identify if "post-market_close" is present.
SELECT DISTINCT "VARIABLE_NAME"

### Thinking Process:
The task requires analyzing stock price data for a specific metric ("Post-Market Close") within a given time frame (January 1 to June 30, 2024). The previous query was simplified to focus on `VARIABLE_NAME = 'Post-Market Close'`, which narrows the result set to relevant variables but still returned excessive data. To make the query more task-specific, we should incorporate the required date range while keeping the focus on "Post-Market Close". This ensures the result includes only values relevant to the analysis and avoids data outside the defined timeframe.

### SQL:
```sql
-- Description:
-- Retrieve data for all tickers, filtering on "VARIABLE_NAME" as "Post-Market Close"
-- and restricting the date range to January 1 through June 30, 2024.
-- This ensures we only fetch data relevant to the task while avoiding premature filtering by ticker.
SELECT "VALUE", "DATE", "TICKER", "VARIABLE_NAME" 
FROM "FINANCE__ECONOMICS"."CYBERSYN"."STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES" 
WHERE "VARIABLE_NAME" = 'Post-Market Close' 
  AND "DATE" BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-06-30' 
LIMIT 20;

Task: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?
Another way to say it: What was the percentage change in post-market close prices for the Magnificent 7 tech companies from January 1 to June 30, 2024?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'FINANCE__ECONOMICS': {'CYBERSYN': ['STOCK_PRICE_TIMESERIES', 'COMPANY_INDEX']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
