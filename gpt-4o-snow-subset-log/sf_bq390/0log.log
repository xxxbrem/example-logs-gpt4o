**Thinking Process:**

In the original SQL query, the filter condition was overly specific (`%qin%prostate%repeatability%`), which might not perfectly align with the actual "collection_name" in the database. Since no data was returned, it is necessary to gradually broaden the search to ensure potentially relevant records are not excluded. 

The goal is to retrieve any collections related to "prostate," so relaxing the condition to `%prostate%` while still using `ILIKE` (case-insensitive match) can help retrieve relevant rows. This captures all collections associated with "prostate," including the possibility of the desired collection being named differently.

```sql
-- Description: Broaden the filtering condition to search for collections with "collection_name" containing "prostate" in any form.
SELECT DISTINCT "collection_id", "collection_name" 
FROM IDC.IDC_V17.AUXILIARY_METADATA
WHERE "collection_name" ILIKE '%prostate%'
LIMIT 20;

**Thinking Process:**

The original query (`ILIKE '%qin%prostate%repeatability%'`) returned no results, indicating that the filter condition may have been too specific. To address this, we need to simplify the condition while still being relevant to the task. Since the goal is to locate a collection related to "qin prostate repeatability," a more general query that uses just the keyword `%qin%` allows us to identify any collection names related to "qin." This broader approach will help us locate potentially relevant collections without overlooking less strictly named entries.

```sql
-- Description: Broaden the filtering condition to search for collections with "collection_name" loosely matching "qin" to cast a wider net and find related records.
SELECT DISTINCT "collection_id", "collection_name" 
FROM IDC.IDC_V17.AUXILIARY_METADATA
WHERE "collection_name" ILIKE '%qin%'
LIMIT 20;

**Thinking Process:**

The original query (`ILIKE '%qin%prostate%repeatability%'`) was too constrained and returned no results. This suggests that either the `collection_name` is named differently or does not match the exact specified pattern. To adjust, the best approach is to simplify the condition further. Instead of looking for the entire phrase, I will search for the most essential keyword, `%qin%`, which is unique and critical to the task. This broader condition allows for capturing any collections related to "qin," which we can later refine further if necessary.

```sql
-- Description: Simplify the filter to search for any collections with "collection_name" containing the unique keyword "qin," increasing the chance of finding relevant records.
SELECT DISTINCT "collection_id", "collection_name" 
FROM IDC.IDC_V17.AUXILIARY_METADATA
WHERE "collection_name" ILIKE '%qin%'
LIMIT 20;
