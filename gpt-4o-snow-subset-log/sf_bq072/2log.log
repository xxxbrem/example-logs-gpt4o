Here are the series of Snowflake SQL queries, broken down into multiple steps, to answer the task while analyzing relevant components of the tables. Each query includes its description, and most queries are limited to 20 rows where appropriate.

---

### Step 1: Identify the ICD-10 codes related to **'vehicle'** and **'firearm'** incidents in the `DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE` table.

```sql
-- Description: Querying distinct ICD-10 codes from the ICD10CODE table where the description includes 'vehicle'.
SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description" 
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- Description: Querying distinct ICD-10 codes from the ICD10CODE table where the description includes 'firearm'.
SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description" 
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 2: Identify death records associated with these specific ICD-10 codes (from Step 1) by joining it with the `ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS` table.

```sql
-- Description: Filtering death records linked to ICD-10 codes related to 'vehicle' from EntityAxisConditions.
SELECT DISTINCT eac."DeathRecordId", eac."Icd10Code" 
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS" eac
WHERE eac."Icd10Code" IN (
    SELECT "Code" 
    FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
    WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
)
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- Description: Filtering death records linked to ICD-10 codes related to 'firearm' from EntityAxisConditions.
SELECT DISTINCT eac."DeathRecordId", eac."Icd10Code" 
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS" eac
WHERE eac."Icd10Code" IN (
    SELECT "Code" 
    FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
    WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'
)
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 3: Retrieve death record details (age, race, sex, year, etc.) for deaths identified in Step 2 (focused on `DEATHRECORDS` table).

```sql
-- Description: Fetching all death records for vehicle-related incidents, with relevant details such as age and race.
SELECT dr."Id", dr."Age", dr."Race", dr."Sex", dr."AgeType", dr."CurrentDataYear" 
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS" dr
WHERE dr."Id" IN (
    SELECT eac."DeathRecordId"
    FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS" eac
    WHERE eac."Icd10Code" IN (
        SELECT "Code" 
        FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
        WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
    )
)
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- Description: Fetching all death records for firearm-related incidents, with relevant details such as age and race.
SELECT dr."Id", dr."Age", dr."Race", dr."Sex", dr."AgeType", dr."CurrentDataYear" 
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS" dr
WHERE dr."Id" IN (
    SELECT eac."DeathRecordId"
    FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS" eac
    WHERE eac."Icd10Code" IN (
        SELECT "Code" 
        FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
        WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'
    )
)
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 4: Narrow down deaths to ages 12 through 18 and categorize by race to determine Black-related deaths.

```sql
-- Description: Filtering vehicle-related deaths for ages 12 through 18, with race and age details.
SELECT dr."Age", dr."Race", COUNT(*) AS "TotalDeaths"
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS" dr
WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
  AND dr."Id" IN (
      SELECT eac."DeathRecordId"
      FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS" eac
      WHERE eac."Icd10Code" IN (
          SELECT "Code" 
          FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
          WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
      )
  )
GROUP BY dr."Age", dr."Race"
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- Description: Filtering firearm-related deaths for ages 12 through 18, with race and age details.
SELECT dr."Age", dr."Race", COUNT(*) AS "TotalDeaths"
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS" dr
WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
  AND dr."Id" IN (
      SELECT eac."DeathRecordId"
      FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS" eac
      WHERE eac."Icd10Code" IN (
          SELECT "Code" 
          FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
          WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'
      )
  )
GROUP BY dr."Age", dr."Race"
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 5: Join with `RACE` and `RACERECODE5` to identify race descriptions containing the word 'Black'.

```sql
-- Description: Fetching race codes and descriptions that include the term 'Black' from RACE and RACERECODE5.
SELECT DISTINCT r."Code", r."Description"
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."RACE" r
WHERE r."Description" ILIKE '%Black%'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 6: Calculate Black-specific deaths for ages 12 through 18 for vehicle- and firearm-related deaths.

```sql
-- Description: Calculating Black-specific vehicle-related deaths for ages 12 through 18.
SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "BlackDeaths"
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS" dr
WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
  AND dr."Race" IN (
      SELECT r."Code"
      FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."RACE" r
      WHERE r."Description" ILIKE '%Black%'
  )
  AND dr."Id" IN (
      SELECT eac."DeathRecordId"
      FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS" eac
      WHERE eac."Icd10Code" IN (
          SELECT "Code" 
          FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
          WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
      )
  )
GROUP BY dr."Age"
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- Description: Calculating Black-specific firearm-related deaths for ages 12 through 18.
SELECT dr."Age", COUNT(*) AS "BlackDeaths"
FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."DEATHRECORDS" dr
WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
  AND dr."Race" IN (
      SELECT r."Code"
      FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."RACE" r
      WHERE r."Description" ILIKE '%Black%'
  )
  AND dr."Id" IN (
      SELECT eac."DeathRecordId"
      FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS" eac
      WHERE eac."Icd10Code" IN (
          SELECT "Code" 
          FROM "DEATH"."DEATH"."ICD10CODE" 
          WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'
      )
  )
GROUP BY dr."Age"
LIMIT 20;
```

Task: Please provide, for each age from 12 through 18 (inclusive), the total number of deaths and the number of deaths among individuals identified as Black (based on race descriptions containing the word ‘black’), specifically for deaths associated with ICD-10 codes whose descriptions include the word ‘vehicle’ and for deaths associated with ICD-10 codes whose descriptions include the word ‘firearm.’ Use the EntityAxisConditions table to determine which ICD-10 codes were involved in each death, rather than joining ICD-10 code information directly on the death records.
Another way to say it: Please tell me the total and Black deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms separately, for each age from 12 to 18.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['DEATHRECORDS', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'AGETYPE', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'RACE', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'ICD10CODE']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
