Below are the step-by-step Snowflake SQL queries with descriptions to progressively extract and analyze the required data:

### Step 1: Explore deaths between ages 12 to 18
```sql
-- Description: Extract death records for individuals aged 12 to 18 to verify the data for these age groups.
SELECT DISTINCT "Age", "Id", "AgeType", "Race", "Sex" 
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS
WHERE "Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 2: Explore ICD-10 codes in ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS
```sql
-- Description: Select distinct ICD-10 codes from the ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS table that are linked to death records, to assess the range of conditions associated with deaths.
SELECT DISTINCT "DeathRecordId", "Icd10Code" 
FROM DEATH.DEATH.ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 3: Identify vehicle-related ICD-10 codes
```sql
-- Description: Find ICD-10 codes with descriptions that include the word "vehicle" from the ICD10CODE table.
SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description" 
FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 4: Identify firearm-related ICD-10 codes
```sql
-- Description: Find ICD-10 codes with descriptions that include the word "firearm" from the ICD10CODE table.
SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description" 
FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 5: Join ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS with ICD-10 codes for vehicle-related deaths
```sql
-- Description: Link death records (through ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS) to vehicle-related ICD-10 codes.
SELECT DISTINCT ec."DeathRecordId", ec."Icd10Code"
FROM DEATH.DEATH.ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS ec
JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE icd
  ON ec."Icd10Code" = icd."Code"
WHERE icd."Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 6: Filter death records for ages 12 to 18 for vehicle-related incidents
```sql
-- Description: Filter death records between ages 12 to 18 that have an associated ICD-10 code for vehicle-related incidents via ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS.
SELECT dr."Id", dr."Age", dr."Race", dr."Sex"
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS ec
  ON dr."Id" = ec."DeathRecordId"
WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
  AND ec."Icd10Code" IN (SELECT "Code" FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%')
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 7: Identify Black individuals using the RaceRecode tables
```sql
-- Description: Verify which RaceRecode3 or RaceRecode5 codes represent "Black."
SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description" 
FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACERECODE5
WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%black%'
LIMIT 20;

SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description" 
FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACE
WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%black%'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 8: Filter vehicle-related deaths among Black individuals (ages 12 to 18)
```sql
-- Description: Include only deaths identified as Black for vehicle-related incidents in the relevant age range.
SELECT dr."Id", dr."Age", dr."Race", dr."Sex" 
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS ec
  ON dr."Id" = ec."DeathRecordId"
WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
  AND dr."Race" IN (SELECT "Code" FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACERECODE5 WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%black%')
  AND ec."Icd10Code" IN (SELECT "Code" FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%')
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 9: Filter death records for firearm-related incidents (ages 12 to 18)
```sql
-- Description: Retrieve death records between ages 12 to 18 that have associated ICD-10 codes linked to firearm-related descriptions.
SELECT dr."Id", dr."Age", dr."Race", dr."Sex" 
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS ec
  ON dr."Id" = ec."DeathRecordId"
WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
  AND ec."Icd10Code" IN (SELECT "Code" FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%')
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 10: Filter firearm-related deaths among Black individuals (ages 12 to 18)
```sql
-- Description: Include only firearm-related deaths among Black individuals for the age range 12 to 18.
SELECT dr."Id", dr."Age", dr."Race", dr."Sex"
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS ec
  ON dr."Id" = ec."DeathRecordId"
WHERE dr."Age" BETWEEN 12 AND 18
  AND dr."Race" IN (SELECT "Code" FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACERECODE5 WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%black%')
  AND ec."Icd10Code" IN (SELECT "Code" FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%')
LIMIT 20;
```

These queries systematically drill into the dataset, enabling you to compute total and Black-specific vehicle- and firearm-related deaths for ages 12 to 18 in the final steps.

To correct the error and generate a single SQL query, we need to combine the logic of querying both `RACERECODE5` and `RACE` into one statement. The solution must ensure flexibility to extract information from both tables while maintaining simplicity.

---

### **Thinking Process:**
1. **Objective:** Identify race codes that describe "Black" from two tables, `RACERECODE5` and `RACE`.
2. **Problem:** Prior attempts executed two separate queries, which is not allowed in a single query execution context.
3. **Approach:** Use a `UNION` operator to combine the data from both tables into one result set.
   - Both tables have columns `"Code"` and `"Description"`, so we can align them easily.
   - Use `ILIKE '%black%'` as the filtering condition to find rows with descriptions containing "Black."
4. **Optimization for Single SQL:** Wrap the `UNION` query in a subquery to consolidate results, ensuring compatibility with a `LIMIT` clause.
5. **Output:** Select distinct rows from the combined results and limit to 20.

By taking this approach, the query fulfills the requirements in a single SQL execution context.

---

### **Single SQL Query:**
```sql
-- Description: Retrieve race codes and descriptions containing "Black" from RACERECODE5 and RACE tables, combining results with UNION in a single query.
SELECT DISTINCT "Code", "Description"
FROM (
  SELECT "Code", "Description"
  FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACERECODE5
  WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%black%'
  UNION
  SELECT "Code", "Description"
  FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACE
  WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%black%'
) AS CombinedResults
LIMIT 20;
``` 

---

This query consolidates the data retrieval and filtering process into one SQL statement, ensuring compliance with the single-statement requirement while achieving the task goal efficiently.

```

---

### Corrected SQL 2:
```sql

    SELECT DISTINCT "Code"
    FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
    WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'
  )
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Corrected SQL 3:
```sql
-- Description: Include only firearm-related deaths among Black individuals for the age range 12 to 18.
SELECT DISTINCT dr."Id", dr."Age", dr."Race", dr."Sex"
FROM DEATH.DEATH.DEATHRECORDS dr
JOIN DEATH.DEATH.ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS ec
  ON dr."Id" = ec."DeathRecordId"

      SELECT "Code", "Description"
      FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACERECODE5
      WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%black%'
      UNION
      SELECT "Code", "Description"
      FROM DEATH.DEATH.RACE

    ) AS CombinedRace
  )
  AND ec."Icd10Code" IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT "Code"
    FROM DEATH.DEATH.ICD10CODE
    WHERE "Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'
  )
LIMIT 20;
``` 

---

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. Queries referencing `"Description" ILIKE '%black%'` in `RACERECODE5` and `RACE` are corrected to leverage a `UNION` subquery that combines their results into a single query for compatibility.
2. `SELECT DISTINCT` is added to avoid duplicate rows in cases where distinct results are needed, such as for race codes and ICD-10 codes.
3. For ICD-10 codes (`"Description" ILIKE '%vehicle%'` or `"Description" ILIKE '%firearm%'`), no correction to logic was required, as these already performed correctly within their own subqueries.
4. Consolidation of subqueries ensures compliance with limitations on statement execution within Snowflake.

Task: Please provide, for each age from 12 through 18 (inclusive), the total number of deaths and the number of deaths among individuals identified as Black (based on race descriptions containing the word ‘black’), specifically for deaths associated with ICD-10 codes whose descriptions include the word ‘vehicle’ and for deaths associated with ICD-10 codes whose descriptions include the word ‘firearm.’ Use the EntityAxisConditions table to determine which ICD-10 codes were involved in each death, rather than joining ICD-10 code information directly on the death records.
Another way to say it: Please tell me the total and Black deaths due to vehicle-related incidents and firearms separately, for each age from 12 to 18.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'DEATH': {'DEATH': ['DEATHRECORDS', 'RACERECODE3', 'RACERECODE5', 'AGETYPE', 'RACEIMPUTATIONFLAG', 'RACE', 'ENTITYAXISCONDITIONS', 'ICD10CODE']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
