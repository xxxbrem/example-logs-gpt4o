[Error occurred]
2025-07-01 04:56:48 - Thread-892 (execute) - INFO - [Corrected SQL]
The SQL error occurred because `"race_id"` is a column present in both the `"RESULTS"` table (`r`) and the `"RACES"` table (`rs`). Without explicitly specifying the table or alias, SQL cannot determine which table the column should come from, resulting in an ambiguity error.

To fix this, the `"race_id"` column must be explicitly qualified by its table alias in the `SELECT` clause. Since the query aims to retrieve information about races and their associated drivers, and we are joining the tables on `"race_id"`, selecting `"race_id"` from the `"RACES"` table (`rs`) is appropriate. This resolves the ambiguity while maintaining the integrity of the query logic.

Here is the corrected query:

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve unique races ("race_id" explicitly from the "RACES" table) and corresponding drivers ("driver_id" from the RESULTS table) for the 1950s, ensuring there is no ambiguity in column names.
SELECT DISTINCT rs."race_id", r."driver_id"

Task: Among Formula 1 drivers who raced during the 1950s, which drivers completed a season in that decade with the same constructor in both the first and the last race they participated in, while also taking part in at least two distinct race rounds during that season?
Another way to say it: Which Formula 1 drivers, during the 1950s, had seasons in which they did not change their constructors at the beginning and end of the year and participated in at least two different race rounds within those seasons?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['RACES', 'TEAM_DRIVER_RANKS', 'DRIVERS_EXT', 'CONSTRUCTORS', 'CONSTRUCTORS_EXT', 'DRIVES', 'SEASONS', 'RESULTS', 'DRIVERS', 'RACES_EXT']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
