### **Detailed Explanation of the ANOVA Calculation Process**

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to performing a one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) on gene expression data, specifically examining the TP53 gene across different mutation types in the TCGA-BRCA project. The goal is to test the null hypothesis that **the mean gene expression levels are equal across different mutation types**.

#### **Objective**

- **Null Hypothesis (\( H_0 \))**: All group means are equal (\( \mu_1 = \mu_2 = \dots = \mu_k \)).
- **Alternative Hypothesis (\( H_A \))**: At least one group mean is different.

#### **Data Preparation**

1. **Select the Cohort**:
   - **Expression Data**: Extract samples with non-null and positive normalized expression levels of the TP53 gene.
   - **Mutation Data**: Identify mutation types for the TP53 gene in the same samples.
   - **Merge Datasets**: Assign each expression sample to its corresponding mutation type.

2. **Handle Missing Data**:
   - Exclude samples with missing expression or mutation data.
   - Ensure each sample is uniquely assigned to a mutation type.

#### **Calculation Steps**

1. **Compute Log-Transformed Expression Values**:
   - Apply a logarithmic transformation to normalize the distribution of expression levels:
     \[
     \text{log\_expression}_i = \log_{10}(\text{normalized\_count}_i)
     \]
     - Where \( \text{normalized\_count}_i \) is the expression count for sample \( i \).

2. **Calculate the Grand Mean (\( \bar{X} \))**:
   - Compute the overall mean of the log-transformed expression values across all samples:
     \[
     \bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i
     \]
     - \( N \) is the total number of samples.
     - \( X_i \) is the log-transformed expression value for sample \( i \).

3. **Calculate Group Means (\( \bar{X}_j \))**:
   - For each mutation type (group \( j \)), calculate the mean expression:
     \[
     \bar{X}_j = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} X_{ij}
     \]
     - \( n_j \) is the number of samples in group \( j \).
     - \( X_{ij} \) is the expression value for sample \( i \) in group \( j \).

4. **Compute the Sum of Squares Between Groups (SSB)**:
   - Measure the variation between group means and the grand mean, weighted by group sizes:
     \[
     \text{SSB} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\bar{X}_j - \bar{X})^2
     \]
     - \( k \) is the total number of groups.

5. **Compute the Sum of Squares Within Groups (SSW)**:
   - Measure the variation within each group:
     \[
     \text{SSW} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (X_{ij} - \bar{X}_j)^2
     \]

6. **Calculate Degrees of Freedom**:
   - Between Groups:
     \[
     \text{df}_{\text{Between}} = k - 1
     \]
   - Within Groups:
     \[
     \text{df}_{\text{Within}} = N - k
     \]

7. **Compute Mean Squares**:
   - Mean Square Between Groups (MSB):
     \[
     \text{MSB} = \frac{\text{SSB}}{\text{df}_{\text{Between}}}
     \]
   - Mean Square Within Groups (MSW):
     \[
     \text{MSW} = \frac{\text{SSW}}{\text{df}_{\text{Within}}}
     \]

8. **Calculate the F-Statistic**:
   - The F-statistic tests whether the group means are significantly different:
     \[
     F = \frac{\text{MSB}}{\text{MSW}}
     \]

9. **Interpret the Results**:
   - Compare the calculated F-statistic to the critical value from the F-distribution with \(\text{df}_{\text{Between}}\) and \(\text{df}_{\text{Within}}\) degrees of freedom.
   - Determine the p-value associated with the F-statistic.
   - **If** \( F \) is greater than the critical value **or** the p-value is less than the significance level (e.g., 0.05), **reject** the null hypothesis.

#### **Important Considerations**

- **Weighting by Sample Size**: When calculating SSB, it's crucial to weight the squared differences by the number of samples in each group (\( n_j \)) to account for varying group sizes.
- **Degrees of Freedom**: Correctly calculating degrees of freedom is essential for accurate MSB, MSW, and F-statistic computations.
- **Assumptions of ANOVA**:
  - **Independence**: Samples are independent of each other.
  - **Normality**: The distribution of residuals is approximately normal.
  - **Homogeneity of Variances**: The variances within each group are approximately equal.

#### **Mathematical Formulas Summary**

1. **Grand Mean**:
   \[
   \bar{X} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} X_i
   \]

2. **Group Means**:
   \[
   \bar{X}_j = \frac{1}{n_j} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} X_{ij}
   \]

3. **Sum of Squares Between (SSB)**:
   \[
   \text{SSB} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} n_j (\bar{X}_j - \bar{X})^2
   \]

4. **Sum of Squares Within (SSW)**:
   \[
   \text{SSW} = \sum_{j=1}^{k} \sum_{i=1}^{n_j} (X_{ij} - \bar{X}_j)^2
   \]

5. **Degrees of Freedom**:
   - Between Groups:
     \[
     \text{df}_{\text{Between}} = k - 1
     \]
   - Within Groups:
     \[
     \text{df}_{\text{Within}} = N - k
     \]

6. **Mean Squares**:
   - Between Groups:
     \[
     \text{MSB} = \frac{\text{SSB}}{\text{df}_{\text{Between}}}
     \]
   - Within Groups:
     \[
     \text{MSW} = \frac{\text{SSW}}{\text{df}_{\text{Within}}}
     \]

7. **F-Statistic**:
   \[
   F = \frac{\text{MSB}}{\text{MSW}}
   \]

#### **Avoiding Common Mistakes**

- **Ignoring Group Sizes**: Do not overlook the importance of \( n_j \) when calculating SSB. Each group's influence on the between-group variability should be proportional to its size.
- **Incorrect Variance Calculations**: Avoid averaging group variances without considering their degrees of freedom. The SSW should sum all individual squared deviations.
- **Degrees of Freedom Miscalculations**: Ensure that the degrees of freedom for both between and within groups are accurately computed, as they directly impact the MSB, MSW, and F-statistic.
- **Data Integrity**:
  - Verify that each sample is uniquely assigned to one group.
  - Check for and address any missing or duplicated data.

#### **Interpretation Guidelines**

- **High F-Statistic**: Suggests significant differences between group means.
- **P-Value**:
  - **Low p-value** (typically < 0.05): Reject the null hypothesis.
  - **High p-value**: Fail to reject the null hypothesis.
- **Post-Hoc Analysis**: If the null hypothesis is rejected, consider conducting post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey's HSD) to identify which specific groups differ.

#### **Conclusion**

By meticulously following the outlined steps and carefully applying the mathematical formulas, one can accurately perform ANOVA to assess the effect of different mutation types on gene expression levels. This approach ensures the validity of statistical conclusions and prevents errors commonly made in incorrect analyses.

#### **Additional Notes**

- **Data Transformation**: The logarithmic transformation of expression data helps stabilize variance and meet ANOVA assumptions.
- **Assumption Checks**: Before finalizing results, perform tests for normality (e.g., Shapiro-Wilk test) and homogeneity of variances (e.g., Levene's test).

Task: Assess whether different genetic variants affect the log10-transformed TP53 expression levels in TCGA-BRCA samples using sequencing and mutation data. Provide the total number of samples, the number of mutation types, the mean square between groups, the mean square within groups, and the F-statistic.
Another way to say it: Assess whether different genetic variants affect the log10-transformed TP53 expression levels in TCGA-BRCA samples using sequencing and mutation data. Provide the total number of samples, the number of mutation types, the mean square between groups, the mean square within groups, and the F-statistic.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'TCGA_HG19_DATA_V0': {'TCGA_HG19_DATA_V0': ['RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION_UNC_RSEM', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_MC3']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
