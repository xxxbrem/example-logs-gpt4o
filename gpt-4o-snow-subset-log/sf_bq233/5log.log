The previous query aimed to find R file content specifically by matching `.r` file paths strictly or loosely. However, since no data was returned, it's crucial to investigate the alignment between `SAMPLE_FILES` and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` at a higher level. I will now simplify the query to include all files and their corresponding content. This approach checks whether `SAMPLE_FILES` and `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` are properly aligned and if data exists in the expected format, before reintroducing specific conditions like `.r` or `.py`.

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve file paths and their corresponding content by performing a join between SAMPLE_FILES and SAMPLE_CONTENTS, without applying specific filters, to verify data alignment and presence.
SELECT sf."path", sc."content", sc."id"
FROM "GITHUB_REPOS"."GITHUB_REPOS"."SAMPLE_FILES" sf

2025-07-01 04:18:36 - Thread-134 (execute) - INFO - [Corrected SQL]
The original query returned no data because it constrained the search to `.r` file paths and relied on a join with `SAMPLE_FILES`. The absence of matching rows suggests either there are no `.r` files or the `library(...)` keyword is not present in the content for the identified files. To address this, I will simplify the query by checking directly for the `library(...)` keyword in the `content` column of `SAMPLE_CONTENTS` without imposing file path or join constraints. This will allow us to ascertain whether `library(...)` exists in the dataset at all.

```sql
-- Description: Directly check the presence of the 'library(...)' keyword in the content column of SAMPLE_CONTENTS to verify its existence, without applying any join or file path filters.
SELECT TRIM(SPLIT_PART(TRIM(SPLIT_PART("content", 'library(', 2)), ')', 1)) AS "library", COUNT(*) AS "occurrences"

Task: Can you analyze the joined data from github repos files and github_repos contents, focusing only on files ending with '.py' or '.r', then extract Python modules from 'import' or 'from ... import' lines and R libraries from 'library(...)' lines, count their occurrences, and finally list the results sorted by language and by the number of occurrences in descending order?
Another way to say it: Can you find the imported Python modules and R libraries from the GitHub sample files and list them along with their occurrence counts? Please sort the results by language and then by the number of occurrences in descending order.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'GITHUB_REPOS': {'GITHUB_REPOS': ['SAMPLE_FILES', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
