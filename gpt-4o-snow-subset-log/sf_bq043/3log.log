-- Description: The issue with the previous query might be that the filter on specific genes ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1') is too restrictive, or there may be missing RNA expression data for these genes within 'TCGA-BLCA'. To systematically debug, I'll further simplify the query by only verifying if any data exists for the 'TCGA-BLCA' project, without restrictions on specific genes or additional filters, while still including key columns related to RNA expression data. This will help confirm if the table contains any relevant data for the project before reapplying filters.

-- Description: Since the initial query produced no data, the issue may lie with the conditions being too specific, particularly filtering on multiple genes ('MDM2', 'TP53', 'CDKN1A', 'CCNE1'). To troubleshoot, I will simplify the query further by focusing only on the project ('TCGA-BLCA') and removing other filters except for one relevant column. This will help confirm whether any RNA expression data exists for the specified project. If data exists, further refinement can be applied to include specific genes or conditions.

-- Description: The "No data found" error indicates that there may be no matching records for the specific conditions. To debug the issue, I will simplify the query by completely removing the filter on specific gene names and focus instead on retrieving any RNA expression data for the 'TCGA-BLCA' project. This approach will confirm whether the dataset contains RNA expression data for any genes in the specified project, serving as a foundational check before applying more specific conditions.
