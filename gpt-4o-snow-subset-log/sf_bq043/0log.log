To address the challenge of no data being found, I will revise the query by taking a step back to confirm the presence of relevant somatic mutation records for the `TCGA-BLCA` project in the `SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02` table. This way, I can ensure that the foundational data linking clinical information and somatic mutations exists. By simply focusing on retrieving distinct case barcodes associated with the `TCGA-BLCA` project from the somatic mutation table, I'll verify that there are entries for this context before linking it with clinical information.

The prior queries returned no data, which suggests there might be a mismatch or absence of the specific gene (`MDM2`) or the related records for the project `TCGA-BLCA`. To verify if RNA expression records exist for the `TCGA-BLCA` project, I will query distinct case barcodes from the RNAseq dataset (`RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39`). By simplifying the query to retrieve only distinct case barcodes without applying constraints like `MDM2` or additional conditions, this will help verify that data for the project exists in the RNAseq table and serves as a foundation for further filtering.

To correct the issue of no data being found for the gene `MDM2` in the context of `TCGA-BLCA`, I need to verify if there is any RNA expression data available for `MDM2` within the `TCGA-BLCA` project at all. It is possible that either the gene or cases in this project do not have RNA expression data available. To confirm this, I will remove the need to link case barcodes to somatic mutation data and instead directly query the RNA expression data for `MDM2` within the `TCGA-BLCA` project's RNAseq dataset. This will simplify the query and focus solely on validating the availability of the gene’s expression data.

```sql

The error in the initial query might stem from either the absence of RNA expression data for `MDM2` in the `TCGA-BLCA` project or a lack of matching case barcodes between the RNAseq and somatic mutation datasets. To troubleshoot, I will simplify the query to verify if *any* RNA expression data exists for the `TCGA-BLCA` project regardless of specific genes or links to the somatic mutation dataset. By removing conditions on both `gene_name` and case barcode linkage, this query will confirm if the RNAseq data contains entries for the specified project at all.

-- Description: Simplify the query to check if any RNAseq data exists for the `TCGA-BLCA` project in the RNAseq R39 dataset.
-- This removes conditions on specific genes (like `MDM2`) and case barcode linkage, focusing only on the project's presence in the data.

Task: What are the RNA expression levels of the genes MDM2, TP53, CDKN1A, and CCNE1, along with associated clinical information, in bladder cancer patients with CDKN2A mutations in the 'TCGA-BLCA' project?  Use clinical data from the Genomic Data Commons Release 39, data about somatic mutations derived from the hg19 human genome reference in Feb 2017.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'TCGA': {'TCGA_VERSIONED': ['CLINICAL_GDC_R38', 'RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R28', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_MC3_2017_02', 'RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R40', 'SOMATIC_MUTATION_HG19_DCC_2017_02', 'RNASEQ_HG19_GDC_2017_02', 'CLINICAL_GDC_2019_06', 'RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R35', 'CLINICAL_GDC_R39', 'RNASEQ_HG38_GDC_R39']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
