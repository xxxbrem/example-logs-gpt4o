### Thinking Process:
The previous SQL queries might not have returned results because the constraints were too strict or the data relationships were incomplete. To resolve this and debug effectively:
1. **Focus on `PullRequestEvent` records**: Ensure that we are still filtering for `PullRequestEvent` types, as the task specifies pull request data.
2. **Verify data availability within the date range**: Retain the date condition for January 18, 2023 (`created_at` BETWEEN 1674000000000000 AND 1674086399000000`) but ensure no other restrictive conditions are applied.
3. **Simplify the join logic**: Ensure the query focuses on the relationship between repositories and their primary languages in a straightforward manner.
4. **Remove restrictive filters**: Eliminate any threshold (e.g., `>= 100 pull requests`) to get results for all languages with any pull request data.
5. **Group by primary language**: Aggregate data by programming languages to achieve insights about pull requests by language.

The goal is to debug effectively by ensuring we capture all available data without introducing overly restrictive conditions. This will help confirm the presence of data and relationships.

```sql
-- Description: Count pull requests for each programming language across repositories on January 18, 2023, without applying restrictive filters to debug data availability.

Task: Which primary programming languages, determined by the highest number of bytes in each repository, had at least 100 PullRequestEvents on January 18, 2023 across all their repositories?
Another way to say it: Which primary programming languages, determined by the highest number of bytes in each repository, have the sum of over 100 pull requests on January 18, 2023 in all its repositories?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'GITHUB_REPOS_DATE': {'YEAR': ['_2016', '_2017', '_2019', '_2011', '_2023', '_2012', '_2018', '_2013', '_2015', '_2020'], 'GITHUB_REPOS': ['LANGUAGES', 'LICENSES', 'SAMPLE_CONTENTS', 'SAMPLE_COMMITS', 'SAMPLE_REPOS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
