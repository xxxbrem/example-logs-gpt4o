### Thinking Process:
1. The original query failed because it might have overly restrictive conditions, particularly filtering only successful transactions with `receipt_status = 1`. However, not all transactions will have this status explicitly marked, which could cause the query to return no results.
2. The focus is to calculate miner rewards by summing the product of `receipt_gas_used` and `gas_price` (representing gas fees in each transaction), which is fundamental for determining the miner's earnings.
3. To simplify, I will:
   - Remove the `receipt_status` condition to include all transactions, allowing for broader data coverage.
   - Keep only the essential condition ensuring `receipt_gas_used` is non-null for valid calculations.
   - Map transactions to their corresponding miners using the `block_hash` to `hash` relationship between the `TRANSACTIONS` and `BLOCKS` tables.
   - Finally, group by miner to aggregate rewards and limit the results to 20 distinct miners.
4. This approach ensures accurate and comprehensive results without invalid restrictions, addressing the issue from the original query.

### Final SQL:
```sql
-- Description: Calculate miner rewards by aggregating gas fees (receipt_gas_used * gas_price) across all transactions,
-- ensuring receipt_gas_used is non-null, and group by miner to determine their total rewards. Limit to 20 miners.
SELECT
    b."miner",
    SUM(t."receipt_gas_used" * t."gas_price") AS "total_gas_reward"
FROM "ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN"."ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN"."TRANSACTIONS" t
JOIN "ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN"."ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN"."BLOCKS" b
    ON t."block_hash" = b."hash"
WHERE t."receipt_gas_used" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY b."miner"
LIMIT 20;

### Thinking Process:
1. The aim is to calculate miner rewards by summing gas fees (computed as `receipt_gas_used * gas_price`) for all transactions grouped by miners from the associated blocks.
2. The previous query likely failed because the condition `receipt_status = 1` restricted the dataset too much, resulting in no matching rows.
3. To resolve this:
   - Remove the restrictive condition `receipt_status = 1` to include all transactions, as this field may not always be populated or relevant.
   - Keep the `receipt_gas_used IS NOT NULL` condition because it ensures that only transactions with valid gas usage are included in the calculation.
   - Join the "TRANSACTIONS" table with the "BLOCKS" table on `block_hash` to correctly map transactions to the miners responsible for the blocks.
   - Group by miner to calculate aggregated rewards for each miner and limit the output to 20 results for simplicity.
4. This adjusted query focuses on the essential calculation without unnecessary restrictions, ensuring that valid data is utilized for meaningful results.

### Final SQL:
```sql
-- Description: Calculate miner rewards by summing gas fees (receipt_gas_used * gas_price) for all transactions 
-- where receipt_gas_used is not null. The results are grouped by miner to aggregate total rewards, and the output is limited to 20 miners.

JOIN "ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN"."ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN"."BLOCKS" b
    ON t."block_hash" = b."hash"

### Thinking Process:
1. The goal of the original SQL was to calculate miner rewards by summing gas fees, determined as `receipt_gas_used * gas_price`, for each block and grouping results by miner. The error "No data found for the specified query" suggests that the query was too restrictive.
2. Upon review, the condition `t."receipt_status" = 1` could be the reason for excluding valid transactions, as:
   - The `receipt_status` field may not always be populated or consistently set to 1 in the dataset.
3. To resolve this:
   - Remove the `receipt_status = 1` condition entirely to include all transactions, regardless of their recorded status.
   - Retain the essential `t."receipt_gas_used" IS NOT NULL` condition to ensure that only transactions with valid gas usage are used in calculations.
   - Maintain the join between the `TRANSACTIONS` and `BLOCKS` tables using `block_hash` to correctly associate miners with their blocks.
4. These changes simplify the query while retaining its core purpose, ensuring it can handle data variations and generate meaningful results.

### Final SQL:
```sql
-- Description: Calculate miner rewards as the total gas fees (receipt_gas_used * gas_price) for all transactions. 
-- Only include transactions with non-null receipt_gas_used. Group results by miner and limit output to 20 rows.

Task: Calculate the average balance (in quadrillions, 10^15) of the top 10 Ethereum addresses by net balance, including incoming and outgoing transfers from traces (only successful transactions and excluding call types like delegatecall, callcode, and staticcall), miner rewards (sum of gas fees per block), and sender gas fee deductions. Exclude null addresses and round the result to two decimal places.
Another way to say it: What is the average balance of the top 10 addresses with the most balance on the Ethereum blockchain, considering both incoming and outgoing transactions with valid addresses, but only those recorded as used on receipt, as well as transaction fees? Only keep successful transactions with no call type or where the call type is 'call'. The average balance, expressed in quadrillions (10^15), is rounded to two decimal places.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN': {'ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN': ['BLOCKS', 'TRACES', 'LOGS', 'TOKEN_TRANSFERS', 'TRANSACTIONS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
