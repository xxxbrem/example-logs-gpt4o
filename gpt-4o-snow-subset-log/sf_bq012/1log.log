Below are 10 progressively structured Snowflake SQL queries designed to examine and aggregate data from the provided tables step by step:

---

Task: Calculate the average balance (in quadrillions, 10^15) of the top 10 Ethereum addresses by net balance, including incoming and outgoing transfers from traces (only successful transactions and excluding call types like delegatecall, callcode, and staticcall), miner rewards (sum of gas fees per block), and sender gas fee deductions. Exclude null addresses and round the result to two decimal places.
Another way to say it: What is the average balance of the top 10 addresses with the most balance on the Ethereum blockchain, considering both incoming and outgoing transactions with valid addresses, but only those recorded as used on receipt, as well as transaction fees? Only keep successful transactions with no call type or where the call type is 'call'. The average balance, expressed in quadrillions (10^15), is rounded to two decimal places.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN': {'ETHEREUM_BLOCKCHAIN': ['BLOCKS', 'TRACES', 'LOGS', 'TOKEN_TRANSFERS', 'TRANSACTIONS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
