To address your task, we begin querying progressively and systematically to retrieve the snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year (2023). Here are 10 different SQL queries structured to interact with the given `HISTORY_DAY` table.

---

### Step 1: Explore `TOT_SNOWFALL_IN`, `POSTAL_CODE`, and `DATE_VALID_STD`
```sql
-- Description: Retrieve snowfalls and related data for all dates and U.S. postal codes to examine snowfall distribution. Limit the rows for initial exploration.
SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD" 
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 2: Filter records with `TOT_SNOWFALL_IN` greater than 6 inches
```sql
-- Description: Focus on U.S. locations where snowfall exceeds 6 inches. Limit results for initial understanding.
SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD" 
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 3: Retrieve records from 2023
```sql
-- Description: Filter snowfall data for the year 2023, where snowfall exceeds 6 inches in the U.S.
SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD" 
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6 
  AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 4: Retrieve snowfall during the specified week in 2023
```sql
-- Description: Focus on the week ending after the first two full weeks of 2023. The week includes dates from January 15 to January 21, 2023.
SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD" 
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6 
  AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 5: Use distinct to find unique postal codes with high snowfall
```sql
-- Description: Retrieve unique postal codes where snowfall exceeded 6 inches during the specified week.
SELECT DISTINCT "POSTAL_CODE" 
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6 
  AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 6: Retrieve snow depth and snowfall during the specified week
```sql
-- Description: Include snow depth (TOT_SNOWDEPTH_IN) alongside snowfall data for more detailed analysis.
SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", "TOT_SNOWDEPTH_IN", "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD" 
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6 
  AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 7: Add average air temperature for additional analysis
```sql
-- Description: Include average air temperature (AVG_TEMPERATURE_AIR_2M_F) to analyze conditions during snowfall events.
SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD", "AVG_TEMPERATURE_AIR_2M_F" 
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6 
  AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 8: Retrieve snowfall and average wind speed
```sql
-- Description: Retrieve data about snowfall events, including average wind speed, for additional context.
SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD", "AVG_WIND_SPEED_10M_MPH" 
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6 
  AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 9: Include average cloud cover percentage
```sql
-- Description: Add average cloud cover data to evaluate its impact during snowfall events.
SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD", "AVG_CLOUD_COVER_TOT_PCT" 
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6 
  AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 10: Combine all relevant columns for final report
```sql
-- Description: Retrieve all relevant columns to create a comprehensive view of high snowfall events during the specified timeframe.
SELECT "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN", "POSTAL_CODE", "DATE_VALID_STD", "AVG_TEMPERATURE_AIR_2M_F", 
       "AVG_WIND_SPEED_10M_MPH", "TOT_SNOWDEPTH_IN", "AVG_CLOUD_COVER_TOT_PCT"
FROM "GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI"."STANDARD_TILE"."HISTORY_DAY"
WHERE "COUNTRY" = 'US' AND "TOT_SNOWFALL_IN" > 6 
  AND "DATE_VALID_STD" BETWEEN '2023-01-15' AND '2023-01-21'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

These queries range from simple exploratory queries to more complex queries focusing on the specific week and including additional data for comprehensive analysis. Adjust `LIMIT` as needed for real scenarios.

Another way to say it: Assuming today is April 1, 2024, I would like to know the daily snowfall amounts greater than 6 inches for each U.S. postal code during the week ending after the first two full weeks of the previous year. Show the postal code, date, and snowfall amount.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'GLOBAL_WEATHER__CLIMATE_DATA_FOR_BI': {'STANDARD_TILE': ['HISTORY_DAY']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
