Below is a sequence of SQL queries designed to analyze the dataset and gather values from related columns step by step. These queries lead up to the task of identifying champion teams for each season. Each query includes a description to explain its purpose.

### 1. Retrieve distinct seasons in the dataset
```sql
-- Description: Retrieve all distinct seasons from the "MATCH" table to get an overview of the seasons available in the dataset.
SELECT DISTINCT "season" 
FROM EU_SOCCER.EU_SOCCER.MATCH 
LIMIT 20;
```

### 2. Retrieve distinct countries
```sql
-- Description: Retrieve all distinct country names along with their IDs from the "COUNTRY" table to prepare for joining with other tables.
SELECT DISTINCT "id", "name" 
FROM EU_SOCCER.EU_SOCCER.COUNTRY 
LIMIT 20;
```

### 3. Retrieve distinct leagues by country
```sql
-- Description: Retrieve all distinct leagues along with their country IDs and league names from the "LEAGUE" table to understand the league structure.
SELECT DISTINCT "id", "country_id", "name" 
FROM EU_SOCCER.EU_SOCCER.LEAGUE 
LIMIT 20;
```

### 4. Examine match details, including team goals and league associations
```sql

```

### 6. Aggregate match results and calculate points for each team in each season
```sql

Task: Analyze the soccer match dataset to determine the champion team for each season across all countries and leagues, awarding 3 points for every win, 1 point for every tie, and 0 points for every loss. For each season, return the championâ€™s team name, the league, the country, and the total points accumulated.
Another way to say it: Analyze our match data to identify the name, leagues, and countries of the champion team for each season. Include the total points accumulated by each team.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'EU_SOCCER': {'EU_SOCCER': ['COUNTRY', 'LEAGUE', 'MATCH', 'TEAM', 'TEAM_ATTRIBUTES']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
