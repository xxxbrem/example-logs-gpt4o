Here are the required Snowflake SQL queries step-by-step:

### Step 1: Get unique `state_name` and `state_code` from the `ZIP_CODES` table
```sql
-- Description: This query retrieves distinct state names and their postal codes to match ZIP codes with their states.
SELECT DISTINCT "state_name", "state_code"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.ZIP_CODES
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 2: Explore `geo_id` and `median_income` in the 2015 table
```sql
-- Description: This query retrieves GEO IDs and the corresponding median income values in the 2015 dataset. GEO IDs represent ZIP areas.
SELECT "geo_id", "median_income"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 3: Explore `geo_id` and `median_income` in the 2018 table
```sql
-- Description: This query retrieves GEO IDs and the corresponding median income values in the 2018 dataset for comparison with the 2015 data.
SELECT "geo_id", "median_income"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 4: Join the 2015 and 2018 tables to calculate the difference in median income by ZIP code
```sql
-- Description: This query joins the 2015 and 2018 tables on geo_id to calculate the difference in median income per ZIP code.
SELECT t2015."geo_id", 
       t2015."median_income" AS "income_2015", 
       t2018."median_income" AS "income_2018",
       (t2018."median_income" - t2015."median_income") AS "income_difference"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR t2015
JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR t2018
ON t2015."geo_id" = t2018."geo_id"
WHERE t2015."median_income" IS NOT NULL AND t2018."median_income" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 5: Map ZIP codes to states using the `ZIP_CODES` table
```sql
-- Description: This query maps ZIP codes from geo_id to their corresponding state names and state codes using the ZIP_CODES table.
SELECT z."state_name", z."state_code", t."geo_id", t."median_income"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.ZIP_CODES z
JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR t
ON z."zip_code" = t."geo_id"
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 6: Calculate the average median income difference by state
```sql
-- Description: This query calculates the average difference in median income from 2015 to 2018 by state.
SELECT z."state_name", 
       AVG(t2018."median_income" - t2015."median_income") AS "avg_income_difference"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.ZIP_CODES z
JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR t2015
  ON z."zip_code" = t2015."geo_id"
JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR t2018
  ON t2015."geo_id" = t2018."geo_id"
WHERE t2015."median_income" IS NOT NULL AND t2018."median_income" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY z."state_name"
ORDER BY "avg_income_difference" DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 7: Explore `geo_id` and employment data in the 2017 table
```sql
-- Description: This query retrieves employment data for vulnerability calculations from the 2017 dataset.
SELECT "geo_id", 
       "employed_retail_trade", 
       "employed_wholesale_trade", 
       "employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food", 
       "employed_information", 
       "employed_agriculture_forestry_fishing_hunting_mining", 
       "employed_construction"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 8: Calculate the average number of vulnerable employees by ZIP code for five industries in 2017
```sql
-- Description: This query calculates the average number of vulnerable employees for five industries in 2017 by GEO ID.
SELECT "geo_id", 
       ("employed_wholesale_trade" * 0.38423645320197042 +
        ("employed_agriculture_forestry_fishing_hunting_mining" + "employed_construction") * 0.48071410777129553 +
        "employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food" * 0.89455676291236841 +
        "employed_information" * 0.31315240083507306 +
        "employed_retail_trade" * 0.51) AS "vulnerable_employees"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 9: Combine state mapping with vulnerability calculations
```sql
-- Description: This query joins state mapping with vulnerability calculations to map each vulnerable count to its corresponding state.
SELECT z."state_name", 
       AVG(vul."vulnerable_employees") AS "avg_vulnerable_employees"
FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.ZIP_CODES z
JOIN (
  SELECT "geo_id", 
         ("employed_wholesale_trade" * 0.38423645320197042 +
          ("employed_agriculture_forestry_fishing_hunting_mining" + "employed_construction") * 0.48071410777129553 +
          "employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food" * 0.89455676291236841 +
          "employed_information" * 0.31315240083507306 +
          "employed_retail_trade" * 0.51) AS "vulnerable_employees"
  FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR
) vul
ON z."zip_code" = vul."geo_id"
GROUP BY z."state_name"
LIMIT 20;
```

---

### Step 10: Combine the top 5 states by income difference with vulnerability calculations
```sql
-- Description: This query identifies the top 5 states by average median income difference and calculates the corresponding average number of vulnerable employees for those states.
WITH IncomeDifference AS (
  SELECT z."state_name", 
         AVG(t2018."median_income" - t2015."median_income") AS "avg_income_difference"

  JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR t2015
    ON z."zip_code" = t2015."geo_id"
  JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR t2018
    ON t2015."geo_id" = t2018."geo_id"
  WHERE t2015."median_income" IS NOT NULL AND t2018."median_income" IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY z."state_name"
),
Vulnerability AS (
  SELECT z."state_name",
         AVG(
          ("employed_wholesale_trade" * 0.38423645320197042 +
           ("employed_agriculture_forestry_fishing_hunting_mining" + "employed_construction") * 0.48071410777129553 +
           "employed_arts_entertainment_recreation_accommodation_food" * 0.89455676291236841 +
           "employed_information" * 0.31315240083507306 +
           "employed_retail_trade" * 0.51)
         ) AS "avg_vulnerable_employees"
  FROM CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.GEO_US_BOUNDARIES.ZIP_CODES z
  JOIN CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2.CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS.ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR t
    ON z."zip_code" = t."geo_id"
  GROUP BY z."state_name"
)
SELECT id."state_name", id."avg_income_difference", v."avg_vulnerable_employees"
FROM IncomeDifference id
JOIN Vulnerability v
  ON id."state_name" = v."state_name"

# Calculation of Average Vulnerable Population

This document outlines the method for calculating the average vulnerable population across various industries based on their employment and vulnerability weights.

## Variables

- Let:
  - wholesale_trade = Employment in Wholesale Trade
  - natural_resources_construction = Employment in Natural Resources and Construction
  - arts_entertainment_recreation = Employment in Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation
  - information = Employment in Information
  - retail = Employment in Retail Trade

## Weights

Each industry has a corresponding vulnerability weight:
- wholesale_trade = 0.38423645320197042 
- natural_resources_construction = 0.48071410777129553 
- arts_entertainment_recreation = 0.89455676291236841
- information = 0.31315240083507306 
- retail = 0.51

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2': {'GEO_US_BOUNDARIES': ['ZIP_CODES'], 'CYCLISTIC': ['STATE_FIPS'], 'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS': ['ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR']}}

Task: Which are the top five states with the greatest average difference in median income between 2015 and 2018 at the ZIP code level, and what is the corresponding average number of vulnerable employees across wholesale trade, natural resources and construction, arts and entertainment, information, and retail trade industries in 2017 according to the ACS Five-Year Estimates and ZIP code boundaries data?
Another way to say it: What are the top 5 states with the highest average median income difference from 2015 to 2018? also provide the average number of vulnerable employees across various industries for these states, using data from the ACS 5-Year Estimates for 2017.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2': {'GEO_US_BOUNDARIES': ['ZIP_CODES'], 'CYCLISTIC': ['STATE_FIPS'], 'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS': ['ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
