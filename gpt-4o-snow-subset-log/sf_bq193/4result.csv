"Demos in this directory:

- [hello}(./hello)

  This demo illustrates how to invoke ordinary (twoway) operations, as
  well as how to invoke oneway operations, use datagrams, secure
  invocations, and how to use batched invocations.

- [latency](./latency)

  A simple latency test that measures the basic call dispatch delay of
  Ice.

- [minimal](./minimal)

  This demo illustrates a minimal Ice application.

- [optional](./optional)

  This demo shows the use of the optional keyword.

- [session](./session)

  This demo shows how to use sessions to clean up client-specific
  resources in a server after the client shuts down or crashes.

- [throughput](./throughput)

  A simple throughput demo that allows you to send sequences of
  various types between client and server and to measure the maximum
  bandwidth that can be achieved using serialized synchronous
  requests.

- [value](./value)

  This demo shows how to use classes, class factories, and the
  difference between local and remote invocations of class operations.

"Script for use with Casper's Self Service when deploying Canon printers. Script checks **/Library/Printers/Canon/CUPSPS2/Utilities/Canon CUPS PS Printer Utility.app/Contents/Info.plist** for the **CFBundleVersion** key value. 

If the value returned is less than the version of the current drivers, the print drivers are installed by a Casper policy before the requested printer is set up. 

If the installed drivers are the same version or higher as the print drivers available on the Casper server, this information is logged and the Canon print drivers are not installed.

Blog post that uses this script is available here:

"curl.js loader plugins
===

Please see the wiki for information about using plugins.  If you're interested
in creating your own plugins, please check out the Plugin Author's Guide
on the wiki (TBD).

All of these plugins conform to the AMD specification.  However, that
doesn't necessarily mean that they'll work with other AMD loaders or
builders.  Until the build-time API of AMD is finalized, there will be
incompatibilities.

Modules that should work with any loader/builder:

async!
domReady!
js!
link!

TODO:

json! (auto-detects xdomain and uses JSON-P)

"docker-mysql
============

MySQL on Docker.

Includes a bunch of cool features such as:

 - Exporting volumes so your data persists.
 - Not running as root.
 - Printing log output.
 - Setting a root password.
 - Creating a user and database.
 - Passing extra parameters to mysqld.

Here's how it works:

    $ sudo docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=password apachestratos/mysql
    da809981545f
    $ mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root -p
    Enter password:
    Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
    Your MySQL connection id is 1
    Server version: 5.5.34-0ubuntu0.12.04.1-log (Ubuntu)

    Oracle is a registered trademark of Oracle Corporation and/or its
    affiliates. Other names may be trademarks of their respective
    owners.

    Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

    mysql>

(Example assumes MySQL client is installed on Docker host.)

Environment variables
---------------------

 - `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`:Â The password for the root user, set every time the server starts. Defaults to a blank password, which is handy for development, but you should set this to something in production.
 - `MYSQL_DATABASE`: A database to automatically create if it doesn't exist. If not provided, does not create a database.
 - `MYSQL_USER`: A user to create that has access to the database specified by `MYSQL_DATABASE`.
 - `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: The password for `MYSQL_USER`. Defaults to a blank password.
 - `MYSQLD_ARGS`: extra parameters to pass to the mysqld process
