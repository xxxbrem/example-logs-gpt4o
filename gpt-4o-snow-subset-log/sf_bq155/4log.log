The base-10 logarithm can be computed using the formula `LN(x)/LN(10)`. With this adjustment, the query aims to compute the average RNA-Seq gene expression for `SNORA31`, transforming these values using base-10 logarithm, and grouping the results by the `sample_barcode`. This aligns with the task's goal of calculating transformed expression levels for each sample.

--Description: The issue causing the SQL error is related to nested aggregate functions and the lack of support for such operations in Snowflake. To avoid this, we break the computation into logical steps using Common Table Expressions (CTEs). 
--Step-by-step thinking:
--1. First, create a CTE (`RNA_Averages`) to calculate the average RNA-Seq expression (`AVG(HTSeq__Counts + 1)`) for `SNORA31`, grouped by `sample_barcode`.
--2. Next, create another CTE (`miRNA_Averages`) to compute the average microRNA-Seq expression (`AVG(reads_per_million_miRNA_mapped)`) for all unique microRNAs, grouped by `sample_barcode`.
--3. In the main query, transform the RNA-Seq average to a base-10 logarithmic scale using `LN(value)/LN(10)` and calculate the Pearson correlation (`CORR`) between the transformed RNA-Seq values and the average microRNA-Seq values.
--4. Apply filters to retain only those pairs with an absolute Pearson correlation coefficient between 0.3 and 1.0 and at least 25 samples for valid statistical analysis. This approach ensures no nested aggregates, adhering to Snowflake's SQL syntax.

--Description: The error arises because the `GROUP BY` clause used in the query is not aligned with the selected fields, violating Snowflake's requirement that all non-aggregated columns in the SELECT clause must be included in the `GROUP BY`. Additionally, the calculation of the correlation includes nested aggregate functions, which Snowflake does not support. To solve this issue:
--1. Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to precompute the required average values for both RNA-Seq and microRNA-Seq datasets. This isolates the aggregation operations.
--2. Apply the log10 transformation (using `LN` for natural logarithm and dividing by `LN(10)`) to the precomputed RNA-Seq values in the main query.
--3. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the transformed RNA-Seq averages and the microRNA-Seq averages in the final query.
--4. Filter the results based on the conditions: Pearson correlation's absolute value is between 0.3 and 1.0 and pairs have more than 25 samples.
--5. Ensure explicit grouping for all non-aggregated fields in the SELECT clause to make the query syntactically correct in Snowflake.

--Description: The error arises because Snowflake requires all non-aggregated fields or computed values in the SELECT clause to be explicitly listed in the GROUP BY clause. Additionally, Snowflake does not support nested aggregate functions, such as `AVG` being directly passed into `CORR`. The solution is structured as follows:
--1. Use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to calculate the averages for RNA-Seq data (`RNA_Averages`) and microRNA-Seq data (`miRNA_Averages`) separately, grouped by `sample_barcode`.
--2. In the final query, perform the base-10 logarithmic transformation for the RNA-Seq averages using `LN(avg_htseq_counts_plus_1) / LN(10)`.
--3. Apply the `CORR` function between the transformed RNA-Seq averages and microRNA-Seq averages. Ensure that the correlation filter condition (absolute Pearson correlation between 0.3 and 1.0) is handled without nesting.
--4. Explicitly list all grouped fields in the `GROUP BY` clause for Snowflake compliance.
--5. Use the `HAVING` clause to enforce additional conditions, such as the number of samples is greater than 25.

Task: In the TCGA-BRCA cohort of patients who are 80 years old or younger at diagnosis and have a pathological stage of Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIA, calculate the t-statistic derived from the Pearson correlation between the log10-transformed average RNA-Seq expression levels (using HTSeq__Counts + 1) of the gene SNORA31 and the average microRNA-Seq expression levels of all unique microRNAs, only considering pairs with more than 25 samples and where the absolute Pearson correlation coefficient is between 0.3 and 1.0
Another way to say it: Help me calculate the t-statistic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between all possible pairs of gene `SNORA31` in the RNAseq data (Log10 transformation) and unique identifiers in the microRNA data available in TCGA. The cohort for this analysis consists of BRCA patients that are 80 years old or younger at the time of diagnosis and Stage I,II,IIA as pathological state. And only consider samples of size more than 25 and with absolute Pearson correlation at least 0.3, and less than 1.0.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0': {'TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0': ['MIRNASEQ_EXPRESSION', 'RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION'], 'TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0': ['CLINICAL', 'CLINICAL_V1', 'CLINICAL_V1_1']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
