[Error occurred]
2025-07-01 04:44:27 - Thread-515 (execute) - INFO - [Corrected SQL]
The error occurs because Snowflake does not support the `LOG10` function directly. Instead, the `LN` (natural logarithm) function can be used with the formula `LOG10(x) = LN(x) / LN(10)` to calculate the base-10 logarithm.  

The task is to compute the average log10-transformed gene expression for the gene `SNORA31` for each sample. To do this, we use the formula `LN("HTSeq__Counts" + 1) / LN(10)` to replace `LOG10("HTSeq__Counts" + 1)`. The query groups by `sample_barcode` to aggregate the results for each sample and calculates the average expression.

Below is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
-- Description: Handle the LOG10 error by using LN to compute the base-10 logarithmic transformation using LOG10(x) = LN(x) / LN(10). This query calculates the average log10-transformed gene expression for SNORA31 for each sample by grouping records by "sample_barcode".

[Error occurred]
2025-07-01 04:47:59 - Thread-515 (execute) - INFO - [Corrected SQL]
The error in the original SQL arises because `"mirna_id"` was incorrectly referenced from the alias `R`, which represents the RNA-Seq subquery. However, `"mirna_id"` is not a column in the RNA-Seq dataset; it belongs to the miRNA-Seq subquery, aliased as `M`. Therefore, the correct alias `M` should be used when referencing `"mirna_id"`. 

This corrected query calculates the number of distinct samples (`sample_barcode`) for each miRNA and ensures that only miRNAs associated with more than 25 samples are included. The corrected alias usage resolves the identifier error, and the logic remains the same to filter the dataset by the specified condition.

Here’s the corrected SQL query:

```sql
-- Description: Resolve the invalid reference issue by replacing R."mirna_id" with M."mirna_id", as "mirna_id" is a column in the miRNA-Seq dataset (M). This query calculates the count of distinct samples for each miRNA, filtering those associated with more than 25 samples.

Task: In the TCGA-BRCA cohort of patients who are 80 years old or younger at diagnosis and have a pathological stage of Stage I, Stage II, or Stage IIA, calculate the t-statistic derived from the Pearson correlation between the log10-transformed average RNA-Seq expression levels (using HTSeq__Counts + 1) of the gene SNORA31 and the average microRNA-Seq expression levels of all unique microRNAs, only considering pairs with more than 25 samples and where the absolute Pearson correlation coefficient is between 0.3 and 1.0
Another way to say it: Help me calculate the t-statistic based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between all possible pairs of gene `SNORA31` in the RNAseq data (Log10 transformation) and unique identifiers in the microRNA data available in TCGA. The cohort for this analysis consists of BRCA patients that are 80 years old or younger at the time of diagnosis and Stage I,II,IIA as pathological state. And only consider samples of size more than 25 and with absolute Pearson correlation at least 0.3, and less than 1.0.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0': {'TCGA_HG38_DATA_V0': ['MIRNASEQ_EXPRESSION', 'RNASEQ_GENE_EXPRESSION'], 'TCGA_BIOCLIN_V0': ['CLINICAL', 'CLINICAL_V1', 'CLINICAL_V1_1']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.

```

### Explanation of the Query:
1. **Filtered_Cases**: Filters BRCA patients 80 or younger at diagnosis and in pathological stages I, II, or IIA, based on the clinical data table.

2. **SNORA31_Expression**: Computes the log10-transformed average expression levels of the SNORA31 gene for each sample barcode.

3. **miRNA_Expression**: Computes the average microRNA-Seq expression levels for each unique miRNA and sample barcode.

4. **Expression_Pairs**: Joins the RNA-Seq data for SNORA31 and the miRNA-Seq expression data on sample barcodes.

5. **Pearson_Correlation**: Calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient (CORR function) between the log10-transformed SNORA31 RNA-Seq expression and miRNA expression levels for each miRNA_id. Filters correlations with more than 25 samples and absolute correlation coefficients between 0.3 and 1.0.

6. **T_Statistic**: Uses the Pearson correlation and sample size to compute the t-statistic using the formula `t = (r * sqrt(n-2)) / sqrt(1 - r^2)`.

7. **Final Query**: Selects the results and orders them by the t-statistic (descending).

Let me know if further clarification is needed!
