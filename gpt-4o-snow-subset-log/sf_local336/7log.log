# Overtake Label Classification

In racing, overtakes are categorized into different states based on specific conditions, reflecting the circumstances in which the overtaking occurred. Below are the classifications and their detailed explanations:

## 1. R (Retirement) - Overtake during Retirement
An overtake is labeled as **R (Retirement)** if the overtaken driver retired on the same lap as the overtake. This indicates that the overtake occurred just before or during the overtaken driver's retirement, meaning they could no longer continue the race after that lap.

## 2. P (Pit) - Overtake related to Pit Stops
An overtake is classified as **P (Pit)** under two scenarios:
   - **Pit Entry**: If the overtake occurred while the overtaken driver was entering the pit lane, and the driver pitted on the same lap, it indicates that the overtaking happened due to the overtaken driver reducing speed to enter the pit lane.
   - **Pit Exit**: If the overtake occurred as the overtaken driver was exiting the pit lane, especially if the driver pitted on the previous lap and the time gap between the drivers was less than a typical pit stop duration. This suggests that the overtake happened while the overtaken driver was potentially at a lower speed, rejoining the race track from the pit lane.

## 3. S (Start) - Overtake at Race Start
If the overtake took place on the first lap of the race, and the two drivers were within two grid positions of each other at the start, the overtake is classified as **S (Start)**. This classification indicates that the overtake was part of the initial racing shuffle during the race's launch phase, where close position changes are common.

## 4. T (Track) - Overtake under Normal Racing Conditions
If none of the above conditions apply, the overtake is categorized as **T (Track)**, meaning it occurred during normal racing conditions on the track, without any external factors like pit stops or retirements influencing the outcome. This is the default classification for overtakes that happen during regular competition.

---

These classifications help to identify and record the context of each overtake with clarity, ensuring accurate representation of race dynamics.







The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'PIT_STOPS', 'RACES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'CIRCUITS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'RESULTS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES_EXT', 'STATUS']}}

Task: In the first five laps of the race, how many overtakes occurred in each category—retirements, pit stops, start-related overtakes, and standard on-track passes?
Another way to say it: How many overtakes of each type occurred during the first five laps of the race?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'F1': {'F1': ['CONSTRUCTOR_STANDINGS', 'PIT_STOPS', 'RACES', 'SPRINT_RESULTS', 'LAP_POSITIONS', 'RETIREMENTS', 'CIRCUITS', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS_EXT', 'LAP_TIMES_EXT', 'LAP_TIME_STATS', 'LAP_TIMES', 'RESULTS', 'CIRCUITS_EXT', 'DRIVER_STANDINGS', 'QUALIFYING', 'RACES_EXT', 'STATUS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
