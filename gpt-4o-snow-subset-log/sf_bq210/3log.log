To solve the issue of "no data found," the approach needs to focus on identifying whether data exists within the specified time frame and subset of interest (US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018). The previous restrictive condition on "claims_localized_html" (`NOT ILIKE '%claim%'`) resulted in no results, which could be due to the lack of data matching this specific filter.

The priority now is to examine the structure and availability of data with less restrictive conditions. A good idea is to include more fields such as "publication_number," "country_code," "kind_code," and "grant_date" to get a broader perspective of what records are available in the dataset. By doing this, we can verify if we have any entries for US B2 patents in the specified period and explore their main details.

Here is the adjusted SQL query:

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve basic information for US B2 patents granted between 2008 and 2018, including publication number and grant date, to confirm data availability and understand the dataset's structure without imposing restrictive conditions on claims content.
SELECT "publication_number", "country_code", "kind_code", "grant_date"
FROM "PATENTS"."PATENTS"."PUBLICATIONS"
WHERE "country_code" = 'US' 
  AND "kind_code" = 'B2' 
  AND "grant_date" >= 20080101 
  AND "grant_date" <= 20181231

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PATENTS': {'PATENTS': ['PUBLICATIONS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
