Below are the SQL queries written from simple to more complex ones, each annotated with its description:

---

```sql
-- Description: Select distinct sessions from the activity log to get an overview of all unique sessions available.
SELECT DISTINCT "session"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve all paths and sessions that contained '/detail' in the path to identify events involving detail views.
SELECT "session", "path"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
WHERE "path" ILIKE '%/detail%'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve all paths and sessions that contained '/complete' in the path to check if conversion events are tracked in the data.
SELECT "session", "path"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
WHERE "path" ILIKE '%/complete%'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve all rows where the "search_type" column is not empty to understand events with valid search types.
SELECT "session", "path", "search_type"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
WHERE "search_type" != ''
LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve rows for sessions, paths, and timestamps before the first '/detail' click event to see sequential breakdown.
SELECT "session", "path", "stamp"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
WHERE "path" ILIKE '%/detail%'
LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve distinct sessions and search types for sessions that have non-empty search types to filter relevant records for further analysis.
SELECT DISTINCT "session", "search_type"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
WHERE "search_type" != ''
LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Identify sessions where the first event occurred before a '/detail' click with a valid (non-empty) search type.
SELECT "session", MIN("stamp") AS "first_stamp"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
WHERE "path" NOT ILIKE '%/detail%' AND "search_type" != ''
GROUP BY "session"
ORDER BY "first_stamp"
LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Analyze the sequence of events per session, tracking timestamps and sessions with events before '/complete', filtering by non-empty search types.
SELECT "session", "path", "search_type", "stamp"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
WHERE "search_type" != '' AND "path" NOT ILIKE '%/complete%'
ORDER BY "session", "stamp"
LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Count the number of pre-click/pre-conversion events for each session (only if search type is non-empty) to identify event frequency patterns.
SELECT "session", COUNT(*) AS "pre_click_events"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
WHERE "search_type" != '' AND "path" NOT ILIKE '%/detail%' AND "path" NOT ILIKE '%/complete%'
GROUP BY "session"
ORDER BY "pre_click_events"
LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Find the sessions with the minimum count of pre-click/pre-conversion events and display the session details.
WITH PreClickCounts AS (
    SELECT "session", COUNT(*) AS "pre_click_events"
    FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG
    WHERE "search_type" != '' AND "path" NOT ILIKE '%/detail%' AND "path" NOT ILIKE '%/complete%'
    GROUP BY "session"
)
SELECT a."session", a."path", a."search_type"
FROM LOG.LOG.ACTIVITY_LOG a
JOIN PreClickCounts b ON a."session" = b."session"
WHERE b."pre_click_events" = (SELECT MIN("pre_click_events") FROM PreClickCounts)
LIMIT 20;
```

---

Each query is designed in escalating complexity to explore the data, filter pre-click/pre-conversion events, count occurrences, and identify sessions with minimal pre-events that meet the conditions. They adhere to the required structure and ensure clarity for sequential understanding of the problem.

Task: For each user session in the activity log table, identify the number of events that occurred before the first '/detail' click or '/complete' conversion, counting only events that have a non-empty search type. Find the sessions with the minimum count of such pre-click/pre-conversion events. If multiple sessions share this minimum count, include all of them in the results. Return each qualifying session along with the corresponding path and search type.
Another way to say it: Identify the sessions with the fewest events lacking both '/detail' clicks and '/complete' conversions, considering only non-empty search types. If multiple sessions share the lowest count, include all of them. For each session, display the associated paths and search types.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'LOG': {'LOG': ['ACTIVITY_LOG']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
