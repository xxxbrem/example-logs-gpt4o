The invention obtains, by means of mutagenesis and sieving, an Aspergillus niger MA-56 CGMCC No.2722 which can take an abundant and inexpensive agricultural byproduct as a fermentation raw material and in which the resulting acidic [beta]-Mannanase has relatively strong stability to heat and pH; and the invention proposes a production method comprising the steps of: taking the strain as a production strain to be inoculated in a solid culture medium that is formulated by bran, dregs of beans and konjaku flour based on the weight part of 60-90:10-40:1-6; fermenting, culturing, drying and detecting the strain to prepare the [beta]-Mannanase in feed. The enzyme keeps the temperature for 1 hour at 70 DEG C, which still can maintain the enzyme activity of about 85%, and keeps the temperature for 2 hours in a pH range from 3.0 to 9.0, which still can maintain the enzyme activity of over 90%, therefore, the enzyme is relatively suitable for being used as a feed additive. The [beta]-Mannanase in feed can be popularized andapplied in the field of feed production."\n  },\n  {\n    "language": "zh",\n    "text": "本发明公开了一种饲用β-甘露聚糖酶及其制备方法，属于微生物发酵和酶工程技术领域。本发明经诱变、筛选获得了一种能以丰富、廉价农副产品为发酵原料，所产酸性β-甘露聚糖酶对热和pH稳定性较强的黑曲霉新菌株(Aspergillus\xa0niger)MA-56\xa0CGMCC\xa0No.2722；并提出了以该菌株为生产菌种，接种于由麸皮、豆粕和魔芋粉按重量份60～90∶10～40∶1～6比例配制而成的固体培养基中，经发酵、培养、烘干、检测制备成饲用β-甘露聚糖酶的生产方法。该酶在70℃保温1h，仍能保持85％左右的酶活，在pH\xa03.0～9.0环境下2h，仍保持酶活90％以上，较适宜作为饲料添加剂。可在饲料生产领域中推广应用。"\n  }\n]', 'description_localized': '[]', 'publication_date': 20110921, 'filing_date': 20090119, 'priority_date': 20090119, 'priority_claim': '[\n  {\n    "application_number": "CN-200910095505-A",\n    "category": "",\n    "filing_date": 20090119,\n    "npl_text": "",\n    "publication_number": "",\n    "type": ""\n  }\n]', 'inventor': '[\n  "LI YANLI",\n  "LIU YONG",\n  "WANG YOULIANG",\n  "XU SHAOCHUN",\n  "XU YAOXING"\n]', 'ipc': '[\n  {\n    "code": "A23K20/189",\n    "first": false,\n    "inventive": true,\n    "tree": []\n  },\n  {\n    "code": "C12R1/685",\n    "first": false,\n    "inventive": false,\n    "tree": []\n  },\n  {\n    "code": "C12N9/42",\n    "first": false,\n    "inventive": true,\n    "tree": []\n  },\n  {\n    "code": "C12N1/20",\n    "first": true,\n    "inventive": true,\n    "tree": []\n  }\n]', 'cpc': '[]', 'fi': '[]', 'citation': '[\n  {\n    "application_number": "",\n    "category": "UNKNOWN",\n    "filing_date": 0,\n    "npl_text": "",\n    "publication_number": "JP-2003174892-A",\n    "type": ""\n  },\n  {\n    "application_number": "",\n    "category": "UNKNOWN",\n    "filing_date": 0,\n    "npl_text": "Tse-Chun Lin et al..Enhanced mannanase production by submerged culture of Aspergillus niger NCH-189 using defatted copra based media.《Process Biochemistry》.2004,第39卷(第9期),1103-1109.",\n    "publication_number": "",\n    "type": ""\n  }\n]', 'entity_status': ''}, {'publication_number': 'CN-101856496-B', 'country_code': 'CN', 'kind_code': 'B', 'family_id': '42942800', 'title_localized': '[\n  {\n    "language": "zh",\n    "text": "胎盘干细胞抗肿瘤疫苗及其制备方法与应用"\n  },\n  {\n    "language": "en",\n    "text": "Placenta stem-cell anti-tumor vaccine, preparation method and application thereof"\n  }\n]', 'abstract_localized': '[\n  {\n    "language": "zh",\n    "text": "本发明涉及生物医学工程技术，特别是一种用胎盘干细胞制作的抗肿瘤疫苗及其制备方法与应用。本发明的疫苗是在小冻存管中保存有培养8代后的胎盘干细胞，每只小冻存管有胎盘干细胞数量为5×105个(200μl)。其疫苗的制备方法有四个步骤：(1)处理胎盘组织，(2)胎盘干细胞的获取，(3)胎盘干细胞的培养并传代8次，(4)制作胎盘干细胞抗肿瘤疫苗。本发明提供一种在肿瘤建立之前可以起到疫苗防御作用的，使机体对肿瘤干细胞产生特异性免疫抗体与致敏淋巴细胞，抑制肿瘤干细胞生长与迁徙，从而达到阻断体内肿瘤发生、发展与转移的细胞生物制剂。抑瘤率可以达到70％以上，可以用于多种肿瘤，如肺癌、乳腺癌、结肠癌、黑色素瘤等的防治。"\n  }\n]', 'description_localized': '[]', 'publication_date': 20130918, 'filing_date': 20100607, 'priority_date': 20100607, 'priority_claim': '[\n  {\n    "application_number": "CN-201010193091-A",\n    "category": "",\n    "filing_date": 20100607,\n    "npl_text": "",\n    "publication_number": "",\n    "type": ""\n  }\n]', 'inventor': '[\n  "WEI YUQUAN",\n  "CHEN XIANCHENG",\n  "ZHOU LINA",\n  "YANG LI"\n]', 'ipc': '[\n  {\n    "code": "A61P35/00",\n    "first": false,\n    "inventive": true,\n    "tree": []\n  },\n  {\n    "code": "A61K39/00",\n    "first": true,\n    "inventive": true,\n    "tree": []\n  },\n  {\n    "code": "C12N5/0735",\n    "first": false,\n    "inventive": true,\n    "tree": []\n  }\n]', 'cpc': '[]', 'fi': '[]', 'citation': '[\n  {\n    "application_number": "",\n    "category": "UNKNOWN",\n    "filing_date": 0,\n    "npl_text": "",\n    "publication_number": "CN-101720354-A",\n    "type": ""\n  },\n  {\n    "application_number": "",\n    "category": "UNKNOWN",\n    "filing_date": 0,\n    "npl_text": "M.

Task: For each publication family whose earliest publication was first published in January 2015, please provide the earliest publication date, the distinct publication numbers, their country codes, the distinct CPC and IPC codes, distinct families (namely, the ids) that cite and are cited by this publication family. Please present all lists as comma-separated values, sorted alphabetically
Another way to say it: For each publication family whose earliest publication was first published in January 2015, please provide the earliest publication date, the distinct publication numbers, their country codes, the distinct CPC and IPC codes, distinct families (namely, the ids) that cite and are cited by this publication family. Please present all lists as comma-separated values, sorted by the first letter of the code for clarity.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PATENTS_GOOGLE': {'PATENTS_GOOGLE': ['PUBLICATIONS', 'ABS_AND_EMB']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
