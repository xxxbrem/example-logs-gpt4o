[{'uuid': 'trk41aa0c2vx03i8zta2low1w', 'patent_id': '8340917', 'text': 'BACKGROUND Research in many areas of biotechnology, such as drug discovery, disease analysis, and crop improvements, involves matching fragments of sequences that are generated from a sample, with long sequences that represent biological components. For example, the human genome is a double helix of sequences of nucleotides, where one sequence is a complement of the other. There are 4 nucleotides in DNA sequences, more in RNA and protein sequences. Each nucleotide in a DNA sequence is represented by a character from the alphabet {a,c,t,g}. Each strand of the double helix that constitutes the human genome is a sequence of more than 3 billion characters. The 2 strands are not independent. For each character position in one strand, there is a complementary character in the corresponding position of the second strand. The characters a and t are complements of one another, and the characters c and g are complements of one another. Each character is also called a base, hence a genomic sequence is often said to contain more than 3 billion base-pairs (a base and its complement). An average laboratory test of a DNA sample takes hours to days, and typically generates over 100 million test fragments, each having a small number of letters, usually between 36 and 500 letters. Although test fragments are in the form of a single strand, a test fragment must be matched against both strands because it is unknown from which strand the test fragment originates. Typically, the test fragments are individually matched to selected chromosomes in a process that may take many hours or days. Matching between the fragments and the chromosomes typically allows for 1 or 2 errors in the match, such as mismatched letters or surplus characters in the fragment, to account for experimental errors. Some algorithms that perform fragment matching while allowing for errors are called BLAST algorithms. BLAST algorithms utilize in-memory analysis and are computationally intensive. Thus, they are generally inadequate for the high numbers of fragments that are generated for matching.'}, {'uuid': '3su3q8p4ekjd6xhnx2t4jys8t', 'patent_id': '9223704', 'text': 'BACKGROUND The present disclosure relates to a memory access control circuit, and more particularly, to a memory access control circuit, prefetch circuit, memory device and information processing system for gaining burst access to a memory. A processor uses a memory both as an instruction storage area and as a data storage area. Therefore, it is necessary for the processor to access the memory highly frequently during the execution of a program. In order to reduce the burden on the memory resulting from such frequent accesses, a cache memory is provided between the processor and memory. A cache memory manages a plurality of continuous words as a line. Therefore, the plurality of words are filled altogether at the time of a cache mishit. At this time, a burst transfer is used to transfer data from the memory. In order to achieve transfer of a plurality of words using a burst transfer, a system is known which can change the sequence of the words to be transferred by using the wraparound function adapted to wrap around the addresses in a specific range. For example, a data processor has been proposed which allows different types of burst transfer such as four-burst wrap (WRAP4), eight-burst wrap (WRAP8) and 16-burst wrap (WRAP16) to be specified (refer, for example, to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2006-155488). As the memory becomes increasingly layered, a prefetch buffer may be provided between the cache memory and memory. In this case, the size in which the prefetch buffer is managed is likely larger than the line size of the cache memory, thus resulting in a larger burst transfer size. For example, if the processor requests a four-burst wrap, it is likely that the prefetch buffer may request a 16-burst wrap to the memory. If the wraparound function is used in this case, and if the start address is the third word as illustrated in FIG. 7A , the remaining zeroth to second words are not transferred quickly, thus causing the processor to stall. The present disclosure has been made in light of the foregoing, and it is desirable, when generating a wraparound memory access request, different in size from the original, to perform start address conversion so as to reduce the processor stall cycles. According to a first mode of the present disclosure, there are provided a memory access control circuit, prefetch buffer, memory device and information processing system. Each of the memory access control circuit, memory device and information processing system includes a determination section, request generation section and address conversion section. The determination section determines whether a target requested by a first wraparound memory access request from a processor is stored in the prefetch buffer. The request generation section generates a second wraparound memory access request including the target if it is determined that the target is not stored in the prefetch buffer. The address conversion section converts the start address of the first wraparound memory access request according to predetermined rules for use as a start address of the second wraparound memory access request. This speeds up the time it takes to complete the response to the first wraparound memory access request, thus providing reduced processor stall cycles. Further, in the first mode, the address conversion section may achieve the address conversion by replacing a lower bit portion of the unit of burst of the start address of the first wraparound memory access request with a predetermined value. In this case, the address conversion section may achieve the address conversion by replacing, of the start address of the first wraparound memory access request, the lower bit portion appropriate in length to the wraparound size of the first wraparound memory access request with the predetermined value. Further, the address conversion section may achieve the address conversion by replacing the lower bit portion of the start address of the first wraparound memory access request with zeros. In particular, if the first wraparound memory access request is intended to request a four-burst wraparound, and if the second wraparound memory access request is intended to request a 16-burst wraparound, the address conversion section may achieve the address conversion by replacing the lower two bits of the unit of burst of the start address of the first wraparound memory access request with zeros. Further, if the first wraparound memory access request is intended to request a four-burst wraparound, and if the second wraparound memory access request is intended to request an eight-burst wraparound, the address conversion section may achieve the address conversion by replacing the lower two bits of the unit of burst of the start address of the first wraparound memory access request with zeros. Still further, if the first wraparound memory access request is intended to request an eight-burst wraparound, and if the second wraparound memory access request is intended to request a 16-burst wraparound, the address conversion section may achieve the address conversion by replacing the lower three bits of the unit of burst of the start address of the first wraparound memory access request with zeros. The present disclosure performs start address conversion when generating a wraparound memory access request, different in size from the original, thus providing reduced processor stall cycles.'}, {'uuid': 'b0qs060fwm3tavltiwk2ye9wl', 'patent_id': '4140085', 'text': 'The invention relates to a method and an apparatus for controlling the proportion of fuel and air in a combustible fuel-air mixture fed to an internal combustion engine. More particularly, the invention relates to an apparatus in which an oxygen sensor (.lambda.-sensor) monitors the exhaust gas composition and generates a signal which is used in influencing the fuel-air ratio. For this purpose, the sensor signal is compared with a set-point or threshold value. Known in the art are systems which determine the duration of fuel injection control pulses by disposing in the exhaust system a .lambda.-sensor which generates an electrical signal that alternates abruptly between a higher and lower voltage depending on whether the mixture fed to the engine is rich or lean. This output signal is used as the actual value in a control loop and is used by the fuel injection system to determine the duration of the control pulses used to actuate the injection valves. The basic duration of the fuel injection control pulses is determined on the basis of two major variables, i.e., the engine rpm and the air flow rate aspirated by the engine. The fuel injection control pulses are generated in synchronism with crankshaft rotations. In this previously proposed system, an attempt is made to maintain the .lambda. control in the critical temperature domain, where the sensor has a very high internal resistance and is capable only to generate signals which are substantially shifted in voltage, by permitting the threshold or set-point voltage with which the sensor output is compared to follow the changing sensor potential. In this process, however, considerable non-linearities are produced. It is also particularly disadvantageous that aging an a dispersion of the characteristics of the sensor make the adjustment and the control process very difficult in this critical temperature domain. It is a principal object of the present invention to provide a fuel injection system with a method and an apparatus to permit reliable controlled operation of the fuel injection system even at relatively low oxygen sensor temperatures. It is a further object of the invention to provide a circuit for carrying out this method which is simply constructed and relatively inexpensiv

An exclusive-OR gate46in the carry circuit142of the logic cell120ofFIG. 4has a first input coupled to the carry-in input CI42of the logic cell120, a second input coupled to the data output P of the third multiplexer36, and an output coupled to the sum output S50of the logic cell120.\n\nIn some implementations of the invention, either of the F0or F1inputs from LUTs124aand124b, or the logic-high constant voltage input can be omitted from the second multiplexer32, and/or the logic-high constant voltage input can be omitted from the third multiplexer36.\n\nThe structural differences between the logic cell120according to the aspect of the invention illustrated inFIG. 4and the prior-art logic cell inFIG. 1are the use of the second 4-input multiplexer36to drive the exclusive-OR gate46that generates the sum output S50, and the addition of a QI counter input140to the logic cell120as shown inFIG. 4.\n\nBroadly, the logic cell120ofFIG. 4has K function inputs, a QI input and a carry input. The particular example shown inFIG. 4includes K function inputs In1138, In2130, IN3132, through InK134. To implement logic cells having larger values of K, additional function inputs can be added, each driving both of LUTs124aand124b. The primary output Y48of the logic cell120presents a value that is any function of the K function inputs. A second output (the carry output CO44) presents a value present on the carry input CI42or an output sourced by the second multiplexer32as selected by the output of the third multiplexer36. The inputs In1, In2, In3, . . . InK, and outputs S and Y are connected to the programmable routing network. The QI input can be driven by the flip-flop associated with the logic cell, as described above in relation toFIG. 2, but need not be driven by the programmable routing network. The carry output CO of one cell directly drives the carry input CI of the next cell in the carry chain, and neither CI nor CO need to be connected to the programmable routing network.\n\nFIG. 5is a block diagram that shows how the logic cell120ofFIG. 4can be used to implement an up counter.FIG. 5shows an N-bit up counter160formed from (N-1) logic cells120-0,120-1, and120-(N-1). As shown inFIG. 5, the second multiplexer32inFIG. 4is set so its output G is the value logic 0, and multiplexer36is set so its output P is the value at input QI140of the logic cell120ofFIG. 4. The carry-in CI input42of the logic cell120representing the lowest significant bit is set to logic 1, and the carry-in input CI42of each of the successive more significant bits is connected to the carry-out output CO44of the adjacent less significant bit logic cell120. Data flip-flops162-0through162-(N-1) each have their data inputs connected to the S output (138inFIG. 4) of the logic cell110included in their respective counter stage. The Q outputs of the flip-flops162-0through162-(N-1) are each connected to the QI input (140inFIG. 4) of the logic cell included in their respective counter stage.\n\nAs shown inFIG. 5, none of the LUT inputs (shown for convenience as In1, In2, In3, . . . InKin an instance of the invention employing K-input LUTs122), nor the Y output, of all of the logic cells (120-0,120-1, and120-(N-1) are utilized in performing the counter function and so each cell can be used to generate any function of the K inputs (In1, In2, In3, . . . InKinFIG. 5) simultaneously with the operation of the up-counter function. This is not possible using any of the prior-art logic cells.\n\nReferring now toFIG. 6, a block diagram shows a variation of the logic cell ofFIG. 4. The logic cell170ofFIG. 6includes many of the same elements present in the logic cell120ofFIG. 4. These elements common to both drawing figures will be referenced using the same reference numerals employed inFIG. 4. The elements common in the logic cell170that are common to the logic cell120are connected as described with reference toFIG. 4.\n\nThe difference between the logic cell170ofFIG. 6and the logic cell120ofFIG. 4is that the logic cell170ofFIG. 6further includes a fourth multiplexer172having a first data input and a second data input. The second data input is an inverting data input. The first and second data inputs are coupled together to the counter input QI140of the logic cell170, and a select input is coupled to configuration circuitry for the logic cell represented by small square174. The output of the fourth multiplexer172is coupled to the first data input of the third multiplexer36.\n\nThe fourth multiplexer172selectively inverts the value present at the QI input134as configured by configuration bit174. The logic cell170ofFIG. 6thus employs the fourth multiplexer172as a programmable inverter to support both an up counter and a down counter function by setting the configuration bit at reference numeral174to pass either the non-inverted or the inverted QI input at reference numeral140. As was the case with the logic cell ofFIG. 4, in some implementations of the invention, either of the F0or F1inputs from the LUTS124aand124b, or the logic-high constant voltage input can be omitted from the second multiplexer32, and/or the logic-high constant voltage input can be omitted from the third multiplexer36.\n\nFIG. 7is a block diagram showing the logic cell ofFIG. 6used to implement a down counter.FIG. 7shows an N-bit counter180that uses (N-1) logic cells. The carry-in CI input of the lowest significant bit is set to logic 0 (instead of to logic 1 in the counter depicted inFIG. 5). As shown inFIG. 7, the output of the second multiplexer32inFIG. 6is set to pass the value logic 1, and the output P of the third multiplexer36is set to pass the value at input QI140of the logic cell170ofFIG. 6inverted by the fourth multiplexer172. As also shown inFIG. 7, all of the LUT inputs of all of the logic cells (0,1, and N-1) can be used to generate any function of the K inputs simultaneously with the operation of the up or down counter function.\n\nOne of the attractive features of the present invention is that, when implementing both up and down counters, as shown respectively inFIG. 5andFIG. 7, the entire K-input LUT portion112of each logic cell120and170that is used remains a

## Patent Citations

Patent citations are citations to other patent documents. They take the form of backward (cited) and forward (citing) citations. Backward citations, also referred to as back citations or cited patent documents, refer to earlier patent applications or grants that affect the scope of the claims of an application. Forward citations or citing documents refer to later filings of applications that are affected by the scope of the claims of the cited document.

## Our Focus

We only focus on patents which are applied in the USA, and particularly in chemistry, biology, and medical-related fields. Concretely, the subsection id of Cooperative Patent Classification (CPC) should be chosen from C5 to C13, or its group id is among the following set:
- A01G
- A01H
- A61K
- A61P
- A61Q
- B01F
- B01J
- B81B
- B82B
- B82Y
- G01N
- G16H

Task: Retrieve the following information for U.S. patents filed between January 1, 2014, and February 1, 2014. The patent title and abstract. The publication date of the patent. The number of backward citations for each patent (i.e., the number of patents cited by the current patent before its filing date). The number of forward citations for each patent within the first 5 years of its publication (i.e., the number of patents that cited the current patent within 5 years after its publication). For each patent, ensure the forward citations are counted only for citations within 5 years after the publication date, and backward citations are counted for citations before the filing date.
Another way to say it: Tell me the patent title and abstract, as well as the publication date, the backward citation and forward citation count within 5 years for those published in January 2014. The detailed requirements are provided in `forward_backward_citation.md`.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'PATENTSVIEW': {'PATENTSVIEW': ['BRF_SUM_TEXT', 'CLAIMS_2021', 'FOREIGNCITATION', 'PATENT', 'USAPPLICATIONCITATION', 'CLAIM', 'PATENT_LAWYER', 'DETAIL_DESC_TEXT_2021', 'MATCH', 'USPATENTCITATION', 'APPLICATION', 'PATENT_ASSIGNEE', 'PATENT_GOVINTORG', 'PATENT_INVENTOR', 'CPC_CURRENT', 'PATENT_CONTRACTAWARDNUMBER', 'USRELDOC']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
