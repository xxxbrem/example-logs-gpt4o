### Step-by-Step SQL Queries

Below are SQL queries to explore the data and ultimately answer the main task about the two wrestlers involved in the shortest NXT title match (excluding title changes). Each query is explained for clarity:

---

```sql
-- Description: Fetch distinct titles from the "BELTS" table to see if there is a belt named "NXT".
SELECT DISTINCT "name" FROM WWE.WWE.BELTS LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Fetch all matches where "title_id" corresponds to the NXT title (based on its id obtained from the first query).
SELECT * FROM WWE.WWE.MATCHES WHERE "title_id" = 'id_of_NXT_title' LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Find matches related to the NXT title with "title_change" = 0 (to exclude matches with title changes).
SELECT * FROM WWE.WWE.MATCHES WHERE "title_id" = 'id_of_NXT_title' AND "title_change" = 0 LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Fetch durations of matches to determine which durations are the shortest for matches tied to the NXT title.
SELECT "id", "duration" FROM WWE.WWE.MATCHES WHERE "title_id" = 'id_of_NXT_title' AND "title_change" = 0 ORDER BY "duration" ASC LIMIT 20;
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Find the match ID for the shortest match (after determining the shortest duration from the previous query).
SELECT "id" FROM WWE.WWE.MATCHES WHERE "title_id" = 'id_of_NXT_title' AND "title_change" = 0 AND "duration" = 'shortest_duration';
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Fetch the "winner_id" and "loser_id" for the shortest NXT match.
SELECT "winner_id", "loser_id" FROM WWE.WWE.MATCHES WHERE "id" = 'shortest_match_id';
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve the names of the wrestlers using "winner_id" and "loser_id" by joining the "WRESTLERS" table.
SELECT t1."name" AS "winner_name", t2."name" AS "loser_name"
FROM WWE.WWE.WRESTLERS t1
JOIN WWE.WWE.MATCHES t2
ON t1."id" = t2."winner_id"
WHERE t2."id" = 'shortest_match_id';
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Find the card ("CARD_ID") for the shortest match to verify additional details.
SELECT "card_id" FROM WWE.WWE.MATCHES WHERE "id" = 'shortest_match_id';
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Use the associated "CARD_ID" to retrieve event details from the "CARDS" table.
SELECT "event_date", "url" FROM WWE.WWE.CARDS WHERE "id" = 'card_id_of_shortest_match';
```

---

```sql
-- Description: Cross-check all details for the related match, wrestlers, and event/database consistency.
SELECT m."id" AS "match_id", m."title_id", b."name" AS "belt_name", w1."name" AS "winner_name", w2."name" AS "loser_name",
       c."event_date", c."url"
FROM WWE.WWE.MATCHES m
JOIN WWE.WWE.WRESTLERS w1 ON m."winner_id" = w1."id"
JOIN WWE.WWE.WRESTLERS w2 ON m."loser_id" = w2."id"
JOIN WWE.WWE.BELTS b ON m."title_id" = b."id"
JOIN WWE.WWE.CARDS c ON m."card_id" = c."id"
WHERE m."id" = 'shortest_match_id';
```

---

### Annotations

This step-by-step process:

1. Understands and identifies valid titles (`BELTS` table).
2. Filters matches for the NXT title with "title_change" = 0 (`MATCHES` table).
3. Focuses on the shortest match by duration.
4. Retrieves the wrestlers' names involved by matching IDs in the `WRESTLERS` table.
5. Validates full match, wrestler, and event details (`CARDS` table).

After the final SQL, you'll have all the necessary details to determine the two wrestlers' names involved in the shortest NXT title match (excluding title changes). You can replace placeholders like `'id_of_NXT_title'` and `'shortest_match_id'` with results from earlier queries.

Query:
-- Description: Since filtering for matches with a specific "title_id" and duration returned no data, this query is revised to retrieve all match durations for records where "title_change" equals 0, allowing inspection of durations across all matches.
SELECT "id", "duration" FROM WWE.WWE.MATCHES WHERE "title_change" = 0 ORDER BY "duration" ASC LIMIT 20;

Task: For the NXT title that had the shortest match (excluding titles with "title change"), what were the names of the two wrestlers involved?
Another way to say it: For the NXT title that had the shortest match (excluding titles with "title change"), what were the names of the two wrestlers involved?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'WWE': {'WWE': ['WRESTLERS', 'BELTS', 'CARDS', 'MATCHES', 'LOCATIONS', 'PROMOTIONS', 'EVENTS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
