Some few-shot examples after column exploration may be helpful:
Query:
-- Description: Retrieve all titles related to the word "NXT" from the "BELTS" table in order to find any potential data related to NXT titles.
SELECT DISTINCT "id", "name" 
FROM "WWE"."WWE"."BELTS" 
WHERE "name" ILIKE '%NXT%' 
LIMIT 20;
Answer:
id,name
20604,NXT North American Championship
20638,NXT Women's Title
21126,NXT Women's Tag Team Titles WWE Womens Tag Team Championship
23153,NXT Championship

67321,NXT Cruiserweight Championship NXT North American Championship
67469,NXT UK Championship
67527,NXT North American Championship NXT Tag Team Titles
Query:
-- Description: The original query was too restrictive with conditions like "title_id" explicitly tied to an NXT-specific ID and "title_change" = 0, which caused no results. 
-- To correct this, the query is adjusted to calculate the shortest match duration for all matches without restricting it to NXT-specific titles. We also ensure "duration" is not NULL.
SELECT DISTINCT MIN("duration") AS "shortest_duration" 
FROM "WWE"."WWE"."MATCHES" 
WHERE "duration" IS NOT NULL AND "title_change" = 0;
Answer:
shortest_duration
""
Query:
-- Description: The original query restricted the results to an NXT-specific title and a manually specified shortest duration, which led to empty results. 
-- This correction removes the dependency on "title_id" and dynamically calculates the shortest match time (from the corrected previous query) to fetch match details where "duration" matches the shortest-duration result.
SELECT DISTINCT "id", "card_id", "winner_id", "loser_id", "duration", "title_change", "title_id" 
FROM "WWE"."WWE"."MATCHES" 
WHERE "duration" = (SELECT MIN("duration") FROM "WWE"."WWE"."MATCHES" WHERE "duration" IS NOT NULL AND "title_change" = 0);

24,3,8,1,,0,1
26,4,4,52,,0,1
27,4,53,54,,0,1
Query:
-- Description: The original query depended on manually entering winner and loser IDs, which may not be effective if prior queries had no results or invalid dependencies. 
-- This correction directly fetches wrestler names using dynamically obtained IDs (based on the corrected query for shortest-duration matches). 
SELECT DISTINCT "id", "name" 
FROM "WWE"."WWE"."WRESTLERS" 
WHERE "id" IN (SELECT "winner_id" FROM "WWE"."WWE"."MATCHES" WHERE "duration" = (SELECT MIN("duration") FROM "WWE"."WWE"."MATCHES" WHERE "duration" IS NOT NULL AND "title_change" = 0))
   OR "id" IN (SELECT "loser_id" FROM "WWE"."WWE"."MATCHES" WHERE "duration" = (SELECT MIN("duration") FROM "WWE"."WWE"."MATCHES" WHERE "duration" IS NOT NULL AND "title_change" = 0));

Query:
-- Description: The original query attempted to fetch all matches across titles with unspecified validation logic. 
-- This corrected query ensures "duration" is not NULL to focus only on meaningful matches and excludes manual conditions for broader analysis.
SELECT DISTINCT "id", "card_id", "winner_id", "loser_id", "duration", "title_change", "title_id"

Query:
-- Description: The original query tried to map IDs to wrestler names without any context or filtering. 
-- This correction retains the query structure but ensures that it retrieves all wrestler names systematically, ready for subsequent data validation or filtering.

Query:
-- Description: The original query attempted to retrieve card details without clear relevance to prior queries.

Query:

Task: For the NXT title that had the shortest match (excluding titles with "title change"), what were the names of the two wrestlers involved?
Another way to say it: For the NXT title that had the shortest match (excluding titles with "title change"), what were the names of the two wrestlers involved?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'WWE': {'WWE': ['WRESTLERS', 'BELTS', 'CARDS', 'MATCHES', 'LOCATIONS', 'PROMOTIONS', 'EVENTS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
