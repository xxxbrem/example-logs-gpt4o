### Thinking Process:
In the prior attempt, the query directly filtered distribution center names for the `Sleep & Lounge` category, which yielded no results because distribution center names do not reflect product categories. The updated approach focuses on relationships between tables: distribution centers (`DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS`) are connected to products (`PRODUCTS`) using the `distribution_center_id` column. By focusing on products categorized as `Sleep & Lounge` in the `PRODUCTS` table, we can identify the associated distribution centers. This approach increases the likelihood of retrieving meaningful results by leveraging table relationships rather than relying on specific naming conventions.

```sql
-- Description: Fetch distinct distribution center IDs and names that store products belonging to the "Sleep & Lounge" category.
SELECT DISTINCT dc."id", dc."name"
FROM "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS" dc
JOIN "THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."THELOOK_ECOMMERCE"."PRODUCTS" p
ON dc."id" = p."distribution_center_id"
WHERE p."category" = 'Sleep & Lounge'
LIMIT 20;

Task: Please create a month-by-month report for the year 2023 that focuses on the 'Sleep & Lounge' category, showing for each month the total sales, total cost, number of complete orders, total profit, and the profit-to-cost ratio, ensuring that the order is marked as 'Complete,' the creation date is between January 1, 2023, and December 31, 2023, and the cost data is accurately associated with the corresponding product through the order items. 
Another way to say it: Produce a 2023 monthly report for the 'Sleep & Lounge' category detailing total sales, costs, completed order counts, profits, and profit margins, ensuring accurate cost alignment with sales data.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': {'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': ['DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS', 'ORDERS', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS', 'PRODUCTS', 'ORDER_ITEMS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
