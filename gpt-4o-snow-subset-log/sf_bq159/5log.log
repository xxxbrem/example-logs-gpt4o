To address the issue, letâ€™s analyze the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Error**: The error indicated that `"ParticipantBarcode"` is not a valid column in the table. Looking at the provided table structure, the correct column name for participant identification in `CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED` is `"bcr_patient_barcode"`. This means we need to replace `"ParticipantBarcode"` with `"bcr_patient_barcode"`.

2. **Objective of the Query**: The query aims to retrieve distinct histological types along with their associated participant barcodes for BRCA patients. The filtering criteria are `"acronym" = 'BRCA'` and ensuring non-null `"histological_type"`.

3. **SQL Fix**: By correcting the column name and retaining the intended logic, the revised query is as follows:

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve distinct histological types and their associated bcr_patient_barcode for BRCA patients only from the clinical data table.
SELECT DISTINCT "histological_type", "bcr_patient_barcode"
FROM PANCANCER_ATLAS_1.PANCANCER_ATLAS_FILTERED.CLINICAL_PANCAN_PATIENT_WITH_FOLLOWUP_FILTERED
WHERE "acronym" = 'BRCA' AND "histological_type" IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 20;
```

The issue in the original query is due to the incorrect column name `"bcr_patient_barcode"`, which does not exist in the `MC3_MAF_V5_ONE_PER_TUMOR_SAMPLE` table. According to the provided table structure, the correct column for participant identification in this table is `"ParticipantBarcode"`. To resolve the issue, the column name needs to be replaced. Additionally, the other parts of the SQL are correct for retrieving mutations for the CDH1 gene where entries have passed all filters.

Here is the corrected SQL query:

```sql
-- Description: Retrieve distinct rows of mutations for the CDH1 gene in the mutation data table, ensuring only reliable mutation entries (FILTER = 'PASS').
SELECT DISTINCT "ParticipantBarcode", "Hugo_Symbol", "FILTER"
