Task: Please calculate the fatality rate for motorcycle collisions, separated by helmet usage. Specifically, calculate two percentages: 1) the percentage of motorcyclist fatalities in collisions where parties (drivers or passengers) were wearing helmets, and 2) the percentage of motorcyclist fatalities in collisions where parties were not wearing helmets. For each group, compute this by dividing the total number of motorcyclist fatalities by the total number of collisions involving that group. Use the parties table to determine helmet usage (from party_safety_equipment fields).
Another way to say it: Help me respectively caulculate the percentage of motorcycle accident fatalities involving riders who were wearing helmets and those who weren't?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': {'CALIFORNIA_TRAFFIC_COLLISION': ['COLLISIONS', 'VICTIMS', 'PARTIES']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
