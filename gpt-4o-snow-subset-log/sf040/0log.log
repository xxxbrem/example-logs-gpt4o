Query:
--Description: Given that the previous query filtering by 'LARGEST_ZIP' returned no data, we will simplify this query by eliminating the zip code condition and instead focus on all unique cities in Florida ('FL'). This allows us to explore the data more generally without relying on the 'LARGEST_ZIP' filter.
SELECT DISTINCT "CITY"
FROM "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."US_ADDRESSES"
WHERE "STATE" = 'FL'
LIMIT 20;
Answer:
CITY
Chiefland
Wright
Land O Lakes
Myrtle Grove
Weston
Goulds
Sebring
Edgewater

Query:
--Description: Since filtering by 'LARGEST_ZIP' previously led to no results, here we simplify the query by fetching the northernmost addresses across Florida ('FL') instead of limiting the query to a specific zip code. Addresses are sorted by latitude in descending order to find the northernmost locations.
SELECT "LATITUDE", "NUMBER", "STREET", "STREET_TYPE"
FROM "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."US_ADDRESSES"
WHERE "STATE" = 'FL'
ORDER BY "LATITUDE" DESC

Query:
--Description: Given the absence of data for 'LARGEST_ZIP', this query simplifies the filtering condition to look at geographic levels ('LEVEL') in Florida. By joining the geography index data for all addresses in Florida ('FL') via "ID_ZIP", we aim to retrieve any hierarchy-related details available.
SELECT geo."LEVEL", geo."GEO_NAME"
FROM "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."US_ADDRESSES" addr
JOIN "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."GEOGRAPHY_INDEX" geo

Query:
--Description: Instead of filtering by 'LARGEST_ZIP', this query focuses on retrieving relationships for geographic areas relevant to Florida ('FL'). It joins the "GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS" table using the "ID_ZIP" of Florida addresses to provide broader relationships for the state.
SELECT rel."RELATED_GEO_NAME", rel."RELATIONSHIP_TYPE", rel."RELATED_LEVEL"
FROM "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS" rel

Query:
--Description: Since 'LARGEST_ZIP' returned no data, this query eliminates the zip code condition and retrieves geospatial characteristics (such as coordinates in WKT format) for any Florida ('FL') geographic identifiers (ID_ZIP). This broadens the scope to look for relevant boundary details.

Query:
--Description: To adjust for the lack of data tied to 'LARGEST_ZIP', this query focuses instead on related cities for Florida by using a broader filter for state-level data ('FL'). Results return related geo names and their relationship types without depending on the zip code constraint.
SELECT DISTINCT rel."RELATED_GEO_NAME", rel."RELATIONSHIP_TYPE"
FROM "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS" rel
WHERE rel."RELATED_LEVEL" = 'City'

Query:
--Description: Instead of restricting to 'LARGEST_ZIP', this query retrieves the top 10 northernmost (highest latitude) addresses across Florida ('FL') directly. It avoids the problematic zip code constraint while still focusing on ordering by latitude to meet the task's intent.
SELECT "NUMBER", "STREET", "STREET_TYPE"
FROM "US_ADDRESSES__POI"."CYBERSYN"."US_ADDRESSES"
WHERE "STATE" = 'FL'
ORDER BY "LATITUDE" DESC
LIMIT 10;

Task: Find the top 10 northernmost addresses in Florida's largest zip code area. What are their address numbers, street names, and types?
Another way to say it: Find the top 10 northernmost addresses in Florida's largest zip code area. What are their address numbers, street names, and types?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'US_ADDRESSES__POI': {'CYBERSYN': ['GEOGRAPHY_RELATIONSHIPS', 'POINT_OF_INTEREST_ADDRESSES_RELATIONSHIPS', 'US_ADDRESSES', 'GEOGRAPHY_INDEX', 'GEOGRAPHY_CHARACTERISTICS', 'POINT_OF_INTEREST_INDEX']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
When asked something without stating name or id, return both of them. e.g. Which products ...? The answer should include product_name and product_id.
When asked percentage decrease, you should return a positive value. e.g. How many percentage points in 2021 decrease compared to ...? The answer should be a positive value indicating the decresed number. Try to use ABS().
If asked two tables, you should reply with the last one instead of combining two tables. e.g. Identifying the top five states ... examine the state that ranks fourth overall and identify its top five counties. You should only answer top five counties.
Use ST_DISTANCE to calculate distance between two geographic points for more accurate answer.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
