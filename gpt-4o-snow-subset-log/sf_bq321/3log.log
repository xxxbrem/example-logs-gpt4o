-- Description: The error is caused because the column "collection_id" does not exist in the "DICOM_METADATA" table. Based on the provided table descriptions, the "collection_id" column is available in the "AUXILIARY_METADATA" table. The "DICOM_METADATA" and "AUXILIARY_METADATA" tables can be joined using the common column "SOPInstanceUID". To address the task, the query will first join the two tables on "SOPInstanceUID", filter rows based on the collection name 'qin_prostate_repeatability' using "collection_id" from the "AUXILIARY_METADATA" table, and then apply a fuzzy string match on the "SeriesDescription" column from the "DICOM_METADATA" table. Finally, only unique "StudyInstanceUID" values will be retrieved. This ensures that the results are scoped to the desired collection and series descriptions.

SELECT DISTINCT t1."StudyInstanceUID"
FROM IDC.IDC_V17.DICOM_METADATA AS t1
JOIN IDC.IDC_V17.AUXILIARY_METADATA AS t2
  ON t1."SOPInstanceUID" = t2."SOPInstanceUID"
WHERE t2."collection_id" = 'qin_prostate_repeatability'
  AND (t1."SeriesDescription" ILIKE '%DWI%' 
       OR t1."SeriesDescription" ILIKE '%T2%Weighted%Axial%' 
       OR t1."SeriesDescription" ILIKE '%Apparent%Diffusion%Coefficient%')

-- Description: To address the "No data found" issue, it is essential to verify that the query can fetch any results before applying specific conditions. The previous queries might have been too restrictive with both the "collection_id" filter and the detailed "SeriesDescription" conditions. 
-- A systematic approach is to first simplify the "SeriesDescription" filter by focusing on partial matches for key terms like "DWI" or "Axial" separately, rather than combining multiple conditions. 
-- This query will check only the "DWI" term in "SeriesDescription" while still joining "DICOM_METADATA" and "AUXILIARY_METADATA" via "SOPInstanceUID", and filtering by the 'qin_prostate_repeatability' collection through the "collection_id". 
-- By reducing the filters, this query aims to retrieve at least some data for validation.

-- Description: The "No data found" issue suggests that either the filtering criteria are too restrictive or there is a mismatch between table structures and column usage. 
-- Reference to the schema indicates that "collection_id" exists in "AUXILIARY_METADATA" but not in "DICOM_METADATA". To properly filter for the 'qin_prostate_repeatability' collection, we perform a join between these tables on the "SOPInstanceUID" column. 
-- To further simplify the query and ensure we get results, the number of conditions in the "SeriesDescription" filter is reduced to include only the most likely match for "DWI". By narrowing the filter criteria, this approach validates whether any "StudyInstanceUID" matches exist and retrieves the distinct ones from the joined dataset.
