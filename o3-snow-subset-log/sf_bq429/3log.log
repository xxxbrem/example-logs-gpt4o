# Calculation of Average Vulnerable Population

This document outlines the method for calculating the average vulnerable population across various industries based on their employment and vulnerability weights.

## Variables

- Let:
  - wholesale_trade = Employment in Wholesale Trade
  - natural_resources_construction = Employment in Natural Resources and Construction
  - arts_entertainment_recreation = Employment in Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation
  - information = Employment in Information
  - retail = Employment in Retail Trade

## Weights

Each industry has a corresponding vulnerability weight:
- wholesale_trade = 0.38423645320197042 
- natural_resources_construction = 0.48071410777129553 
- arts_entertainment_recreation = 0.89455676291236841
- information = 0.31315240083507306 
- retail = 0.51

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2': {'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS': ['BLOCKGROUP_2014_5YR', 'CBSA_2007_1YR', 'CENSUSTRACT_2011_5YR', 'CONGRESSIONALDISTRICT_2010_5YR', 'PLACE_2011_3YR', 'SCHOOLDISTRICTSECONDARY_2010_5YR', 'PUMA_2008_3YR', 'SCHOOLDISTRICTELEMENTARY_2010_1YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR', 'BLOCKGROUP_2015_5YR', 'BLOCKGROUP_2017_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2014_5YR'], 'CYCLISTIC': ['STATE_FIPS']}}

Task: Which are the top five states with the greatest average difference in median income between 2015 and 2018 at the ZIP code level, and what is the corresponding average number of vulnerable employees across wholesale trade, natural resources and construction, arts and entertainment, information, and retail trade industries in 2017 according to the ACS Five-Year Estimates and ZIP code boundaries data?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS_2': {'CENSUS_BUREAU_ACS': ['BLOCKGROUP_2014_5YR', 'CBSA_2007_1YR', 'CENSUSTRACT_2011_5YR', 'CONGRESSIONALDISTRICT_2010_5YR', 'PLACE_2011_3YR', 'SCHOOLDISTRICTSECONDARY_2010_5YR', 'PUMA_2008_3YR', 'SCHOOLDISTRICTELEMENTARY_2010_1YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2015_5YR', 'BLOCKGROUP_2015_5YR', 'BLOCKGROUP_2017_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2017_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2018_5YR', 'ZIP_CODES_2014_5YR'], 'CYCLISTIC': ['STATE_FIPS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
