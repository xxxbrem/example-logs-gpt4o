# Push Notification Analysis

## Overview
This document details an SQL query that analyzes user responses to push notifications within the timeframe of 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM on June 1, 2023. It is designed to assess the impact and effectiveness of push notification campaigns across various metrics.

## Data Sources
The analysis utilizes four distinct subqueries pulling from push notification event views:
- **Send Events**
- **Bounce Events**
- **Open Events**
- **Influenced Open Events**

## Query Description
Each subquery counts and categorizes events based on the type of interaction (sent, bounced, opened, influenced open), along with detailed user and device information.

### Send Events
- **Table**: `USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_SEND_VIEW`
- **Columns**: ID, app group ID, user ID, campaign ID, message variation ID, platform, ad tracking enabled, event timestamp

### Bounce Events
- **Table**: `USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_BOUNCE_VIEW`
- **Columns**: Same as Send Events

### Open Events
- **Table**: `USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_OPEN_VIEW`
- **Columns**: Same as Send Events plus carrier, browser, and device model

### Influenced Open Events
- **Table**: `USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_INFLUENCEDOPEN_VIEW`
- **Columns**: Same as Open Events

## Results Aggregation
The final output of the query is grouped by:
- App Group ID
- Campaign ID
- User ID
- Message Variation ID
- Platform
- Ad Tracking Enabled
- Device Information (Carrier, Browser, Device Model)

### Metrics Included
- `push_notification_sends`: Total number of notifications sent.
- `unique_push_notification_sends`: Number of unique users who received notifications.
- `push_notification_bounced`: Total number of notifications that bounced.
- `unique_push_notification_bounced`: Number of unique users who received bounced notifications.
- `push_notification_open`: Total number of notifications opened.
- `unique_push_notification_opened`: Number of unique users who opened notifications.
- `push_notification_influenced_open`: Total number of indirectly opened notifications.
- `unique_push_notification_influenced_open`: Number of unique users who opened notifications indirectly.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the reach and responsiveness of users to push notifications, helping to guide future marketing strategies and campaign optimizations.

The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'BRAZE_USER_EVENT_DEMO_DATASET': {'PUBLIC': ['USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_OPEN_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_IOSFOREGROUND_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_OPEN_SHARED_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_SEND_VIEW', 'USERS_CAMPAIGNS_ENROLLINCONTROL_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_INFLUENCEDOPEN_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_IOSFOREGROUND_SHARED_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_SEND_SHARED_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_BOUNCE_SHARED_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_BOUNCE_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_INFLUENCEDOPEN_SHARED_VIEW']}}

Task: Examine user engagement with push notifications within a specified one-hour window on June 1, 2023.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'BRAZE_USER_EVENT_DEMO_DATASET': {'PUBLIC': ['USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_OPEN_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_IOSFOREGROUND_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_OPEN_SHARED_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_SEND_VIEW', 'USERS_CAMPAIGNS_ENROLLINCONTROL_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_INFLUENCEDOPEN_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_IOSFOREGROUND_SHARED_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_SEND_SHARED_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_BOUNCE_SHARED_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_BOUNCE_VIEW', 'USERS_MESSAGES_PUSHNOTIFICATION_INFLUENCEDOPEN_SHARED_VIEW']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
