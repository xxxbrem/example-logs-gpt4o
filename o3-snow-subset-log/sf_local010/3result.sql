   1. Extract airport longitude / latitude and city names.
   2. Calculate the Haversine distance for every flight.
   3. Make the city-pair direction-independent and average
      the distances for each unique pair.
   4. Bucket the average distances.
   5. Count pairs in every bucket and return the smallest
      (i.e. the emptiest bucketâ€™s size).
