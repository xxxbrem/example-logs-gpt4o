Task: From January 1, 2019, to April 30, 2022, how many users are at the youngest age and how many users are at the oldest age for each gender in the e-commerce platform, counting both youngest and oldest users separately for each gender?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': {'THELOOK_ECOMMERCE': ['DISTRIBUTION_CENTERS', 'ORDERS', 'USERS', 'EVENTS', 'INVENTORY_ITEMS', 'PRODUCTS', 'ORDER_ITEMS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
