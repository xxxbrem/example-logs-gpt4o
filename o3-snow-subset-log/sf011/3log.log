Column name: TotalStatePopulation Type: NUMBER Description: Total State or territory population using MetricID = “B01003_001E”, known as “Total Population” in each Census hierarchy. This is to be used as a GroupBy or Aggregate column.
Column name: MetricID Type: TEXT Description: A unique identifier for a specific metric or measurement within the American Community Survey or census data.
Column name: StateBenchmarkValue Type: FLOAT Description: The Int value for the MetricID and StateAbbrev relationship. This could be aggregates or estimates of people, pets, household, etc. Refer to the Dim_CensusMetrics table for the meaning of each value. All values have been rolled up correctly according to the Census hierarchy in the Dim_CensusGeography table.
Column name: TotalUSPopulation Type: NUMBER Description: Total United States population using MetricID = “B01003_001E”, known as “Total Population” in each Census hierarchy. This is to be used as a GroupBy or Aggregate column.

Task: Determine the population distribution within each block group relative to its census tract in New York State using 2021 ACS data. Include block group ID, census value, state county tract ID, total tract population, and the population ratio of each block group.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'CENSUS_GALAXY__ZIP_CODE_TO_BLOCK_GROUP_SAMPLE': {'PUBLIC': ['Xref_TractToZip_Residential', 'Xref_ZipToTract_Residential', 'Fact_CensusValues_ACS2021', 'Dim_CensusMetrics', 'Fact_CensusValues_ACS2021_ByZip', 'LU_GeographyExpanded', 'Dim_CensusGeography', 'Fact_StateBenchmark_ACS2021']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
