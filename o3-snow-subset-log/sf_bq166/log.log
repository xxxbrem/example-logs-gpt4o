### Comprehensive Guide to Copy Number Variations in Cancer Genomics

#### **1. Introduction to Copy Number Variations (CNVs)**

Copy number variations (CNVs) are changes in the genome where regions have altered numbers of DNA segments. These variations include amplifications or deletions, significantly impacting genetic diversity and disease progression, particularly in cancer.

#### **2. The Role of CNVs in Cancer**

CNVs can drive cancer progression by amplifying oncogenes or deleting tumor suppressor genes, affecting gene dosage and cellular control mechanisms.

#### **3. TCGA-KIRC Project Overview**

The TCGA Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma (KIRC) project offers crucial CNV data to enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of kidney cancer.

#### **4. CytoBands and Their Genomic Significance**

CytoBands are chromosomal regions identified by staining patterns that help localize genetic functions and structural features.

#### **5. Data Sources for CNV Analysis**

- **TCGA CNV Data**: Provides genomic copy number changes in cancer tissues.
- **Mitelman Database (CytoBands_hg38)**: Offers detailed cytoband data for mapping CNVs to chromosomes.

#### **6. CNV Categories and Their Implications in Cancer**

- **Amplifications** (>3 copies): Lead to oncogene overexpression, accelerating tumor growth.
- **Gains** (=3 copies): Cause subtle changes in gene dosage, potentially enhancing cancer progression.
- **Homozygous Deletions** (0 copies): Result in the loss of both copies of tumor suppressor genes, promoting tumor development.
- **Heterozygous Deletions** (1 copy): Reduce the dosage of key regulatory genes, contributing to tumor progression.
- **Normal Diploid** (2 copies): Maintain standard genomic copies, serving as a baseline for comparative analysis.

#### **7. Methodology for Determining Overlaps**

To localize CNVs within specific cytobands, we use:

\[ \text{Overlap} = \max(0, \min(\text{end\_pos}, \text{hg38\_stop}) - \max(\text{start\_pos}, \text{hg38\_start})) \]

This formula ensures that the overlap measurement is the actual intersected length of the CNV and cytoband segments. It uses:
- `\min(\text{end\_pos}, \text{hg38\_stop})` to find the smallest endpoint between the CNV segment and the cytoband.
- `\max(\text{start\_pos}, \text{hg38\_start})` to find the largest start point between the CNV segment and the cytoband.
- The `max(0, ...)` function ensures that the overlap cannot be negative, which would indicate no actual overlap.


#### **8. Conclusion**

Analyzing CNVs is crucial for understanding cancer genetics and developing targeted therapies. Integrating CNV analysis with traditional markers enhances our insights into tumor biology.

Task: Using segment-level copy number data from the copy_number_segment_allelic_hg38_gdc_r23 dataset restricted to 'TCGA-KIRC' samples, merge these segments with the cytogenetic band definitions in 'CytoBands_hg38' to identify each sample’s maximum copy number per cytoband. Classify these maximum copy numbers into amplifications (>3), gains (=3), homozygous deletions (=0), heterozygous deletions (=1), or normal (=2), then calculate the frequency of each subtype out of the total number of distinct cases, and finally present these frequencies as percentages sorted by chromosome and cytoband.

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'TCGA_MITELMAN': {'PROD': ['CYTOCONVERTED', 'CYTOBANDS_HG38'], 'TCGA_VERSIONED': ['COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_MASKED_HG19_GDC_2017_02', 'COPY_NUMBER_GENE_LEVEL_HG38_GDC_R36', 'COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_ALLELIC_HG38_GDC_R23', 'COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_MASKED_HG38_GDC_2017_02', 'COPY_NUMBER_SEGMENT_MASKED_HG38_GDC_R14']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
