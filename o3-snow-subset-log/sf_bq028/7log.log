Improper application of CSP isn't itself a vulnerability, but it does fail to prevent XSS in the event that there is a viable attack vector for an XSS attack.\n\n### Impact\nThere aren't any XSS attack vectors via the Apollo Server landing pages _known to Apollo_, so to our knowledge there is no impact. However, if there are existing XSS vectors that haven't been reported and patched, then all users of Apollo Server's landing pages have a vulnerability which won't be prevented by the current CSP implemented by the landing pages.\n\nPrior to version 4.7.1, there was no CSP implemented at all. However, the initial CSP implementation (4.7.1+) reused nonces. While this sufficiently resolved the issue w.r.t. scripts not running in Safari, it did not implement CSP in a safe or conventional way.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue is patched in the latest version of Apollo Server, v4.7.4. The changes can be reviewed in [the merge commit](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/0adaf80d1ee51d8c7e5fd863c04478536d15eb8c).\n\n### Workarounds\nThe landing page can be disabled completely until the patch can be upgraded to.\nhttps://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/api/plugin/landing-pages/#disabling-the-landing-page\n\n### References\nhttps://content-security-policy.com/nonce/", 'ReferenceURLs': '[\n  "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server",\n  "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/commit/0adaf80d1ee51d8c7e5fd863c04478536d15eb8c",\n  "https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-68jh-rf6x-836f",\n  "https://github.com/github/advisory-database/blob/main/advisories/github-reviewed/2023/06/GHSA-68jh-rf6x-836f/GHSA-68jh-rf6x-836f.json"\n]', 'CVSS3Score': None, 'Severity': 'UNKNOWN', 'GitHubSeverity': 'LOW', 'Disclosed': 1686944453000000, 'Packages': '[\n  {\n    "AffectedVersions": "Introduced: 4.7.1, Fixed: 4.7.4",\n    "Name": "@apollo/server",\n    "System": "NPM",\n    "UnaffectedVersions": ""\n  }\n]', 'Aliases': '[]'}, {'SnapshotAt': 1694466085316347, 'Source': 'OSV', 'SourceID': 'GHSA-qvjr-x8fw-hghv', 'SourceURL': 'https://osv.dev/vulnerability/GHSA-qvjr-x8fw-hghv', 'Title': 'Credentials stored in plain text by Jenkins TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin', 'Description': 'TraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin 2.23.1 and earlier stores credentials unencrypted in its global configuration file `de.tracetronic.jenkins.plugins.ecutest.report.atx.installation.ATXInstallation.xml` on the Jenkins controller as part of its configuration.\n\nThese credentials can be viewed by users with access to the Jenkins controller file system.\n\nTraceTronic ECU-TEST Plugin 2.24 adds a new option type for sensitive options.

allocated arrays by passing in invalid tensor values to `tf.raw_ops.RaggedCross`:\n\n```python\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nragged_values = []\nragged_row_splits = [] \nsparse_indices = []\nsparse_values = []\nsparse_shape = []\n\ndense_inputs_elem = tf.constant([], shape=[92, 0], dtype=tf.int64)\ndense_inputs = [dense_inputs_elem]\n\ninput_order = "R"\nhashed_output = False\nnum_buckets = 0\nhash_key = 0 \n\ntf.raw_ops.RaggedCross(ragged_values=ragged_values,\n    ragged_row_splits=ragged_row_splits,\n    sparse_indices=sparse_indices,\n    sparse_values=sparse_values,\n    sparse_shape=sparse_shape,\n    dense_inputs=dense_inputs,\n    input_order=input_order,\n    hashed_output=hashed_output,\n    num_buckets=num_buckets,\n    hash_key=hash_key,\n    out_values_type=tf.int64,\n    out_row_splits_type=tf.int64)\n```\n\nThis is because the [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/efea03b38fb8d3b81762237dc85e579cc5fc6e87/tensorflow/core/kernels/ragged_cross_op.cc#L456-L487) lacks validation for the user supplied arguments:\n\n```cc\nint next_ragged = 0;\nint next_sparse = 0;\nint next_dense = 0;\nfor (char c : input_order_) {\n  if (c == \'R\') {\n    TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(BuildRaggedFeatureReader(\n        ragged_values_list[next_ragged], ragged_splits_list[next_ragged],\n        features));\n    next_ragged++;\n  } else if (c == \'S\') {\n    TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(BuildSparseFeatureReader(\n        sparse_indices_list[next_sparse], sparse_values_list[next_sparse],\n        batch_size, features));\n    next_sparse++;\n  } else if (c == \'D\') {\n    TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(\n        BuildDenseFeatureReader(dense_list[next_dense++], features));\n  }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\nEach of the above branches call a helper function after accessing array elements via a `*_list[next_*]` pattern, followed by incrementing the `next_*` index. However, as there is no validation that the `next_*` values are in the valid range for the corresponding `*_list` arrays, this results in heap OOB reads.\n\n### Patches\nWe have patched the issue in GitHub commit [44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/44b7f486c0143f68b56c34e2d01e146ee445134a).\n\nThe fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0.

Task: Considering only the latest release versions of NPM package, which packages are the top 8 most popular based on the Github star number, as well as their versions?

Please think step by step and answer only one complete SQL in snowflake dialect in ```sql``` format.
SQL usage example: ```sql
SELECT "COLUMN_NAME" FROM DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE WHERE ... ``` (Adjust "DATABASE", "SCHEMA", and "TABLE" to match actual names, ensure all column names are enclosed in double quotations)
Here are some useful tips for answering:
When performing a UNION operation on many tables, ensure that all table names are explicitly listed. Union first and then add condition and selection. e.g. SELECT "col1", "col2" FROM (TABLE1 UNION ALL TABLE2) WHERE ...; Don't write sqls as (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE1 WHERE ...) UNION ALL (SELECT col1, col2 FROM TABLE2 WHERE ...); Don't use ['-- Include all', '-- Omit', '-- Continue', '-- Union all', '-- ...', '-- List all', '-- Replace this', '-- Each table', '-- Add other'] to omit any table. Table names here: The table structure information is ({database name: {schema name: [table name]}}): 
{'DEPS_DEV_V1': {'DEPS_DEV_V1': ['PROJECTS', 'DEPENDENCIES', 'DEPENDENCYGRAPHEDGES', 'DEPENDENTS', 'PACKAGEVERSIONHASHES', 'SNAPSHOTS', 'ADVISORIES', 'PACKAGEVERSIONS', 'PACKAGEVERSIONTOPROJECT', 'NUGETREQUIREMENTS']}}

When using ORDER BY xxx DESC, add NULLS LAST to exclude null records: ORDER BY xxx DESC NULLS LAST.
If the task description does not specify the number of decimal places, retain all decimals to four places.
